We were couped up in the classroom for 4 stinking hours without a break because he forgot to give us one..or two..I was seriously about to kill someone. we didn't even talk about driving most of the time!!! On the bright side...this whole thing will be done in a month and I can have a summer!! It has been raining here. And cold...like winter...without snow. I want it to be summer!!! I am sick of rain. I want it to be warm. Maybe next week...         \",\n",
       " \"       \\x16Post.  This is my blog.  Yo.  Yo.  Kick it DJ, spin dat beat. I left Florida Friday night and got to Dubuque, Iowa Saturday night.  I met Sara Jean at The Village Inn on Dodge St. and we drank coffee and had french toast.  It was good.  Then we went to her house, showered up and went to a Salsa House Party.  Salsa as in dancing, not a mexican dip party.  The party was wild and out of control and huge.  So many sexy women with beers in the cleevage.  It was bizarre but I behaved myself like a perfect gentleman because Sara Jean was there.  Later, Sara and I bought bubble guns and shot bubbles all over Dubuque.   We even made a little video with a digital camera.  I had a great time with Sara Jean.  I got to Osage on Monday afternoon and hung out with the family.  Monday night I went for a drive in the country with my brother, Ryan.  I drove out to the house that Jill used to live in...and I spent some time on the one lane bridge.  I told Ryan a little bit about her, but mostly I didn't say anything.  That was good, but I'm going back there tonight, by myself, and I'm going to stay there longer.  Yesterday (Tuesday) Ryan, my pops, and I went to visit my sister, Meghan, in Ames, Iowa.  She's going to school at Iowa State.  She's a cyclone.  We all ate coffee and I bought a black soccor ball and we all went out to a soccor field and played soccor until it had been dark for an hour.  Playing soccor by moon light with a black ball is really hard, especially if your the goalie.  I made my brother be the goalie.  HA HA HA.  Today or tomorrow, I plan on goign to the Spam museum in Ausitn, MN.  My friend Chris Klatt should be coming down tomorrow or so.  I'll be here until Saturday and then I'll be heading back to Florida.  Crappy crappy Florida.  But for now, I'm having a very good time.

Wilson called me from HK...talked about parties....haven't for awhile..so that was nice too!  Today is....boxing day!  boxing day find...  vintage bag $6 2 sets of hair ties $.75 each set sunglasses from Pharsyde $10 Short green punky army colour skirt for $13 Hurley red/dr blue half fingers arm warmer $10 fat shoelaces $1.80  ..then I have some shoe dilemas....if u can help me decide leave me a msg in the comment :)  These are shoes from Aldo, they are only $25...they are actually brown with beige, suede. I couldn't decide if I should get these or the same style but with black and red stripe, so I got these.     Then, I found kewl unique beige fabric  urlLink etniesplus , and supposingly half price (psychology?). They are not available in US, only few stores carry in canada, and rest are in japan. I got them for $62 ($70 including tax), no question these are ones that I will love to love. And I still love the phat shoe style!       I was gonna exchange the boots for the black and red but they wouldn't do it today cuz too busy. I went home and tried on with that skirt....look, they are so damn cute....     So do you think I should buy another pair of black and red ones or trade them in, or just keep these? The black ones would look great with my black capris though! But yeah usually I don't like getting same style in 2 colours.          \",\n",
       " \"           \\x02MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GET BREAST IMPLANTS\\x02 I admit it, I turned on Ricky Lake today as I was cleaning the house.  You know, like you do for background noise...  but as you know, these shows are like train wrecks... you just sort of find yourself watching them and wondering what these poor people did in some former life to be run over by the karma train and end up on Jerry Springer or Ricky Lake.  (as even Jerry Springer mentioned to the audience in one of his shows, 'If you're on this show... you know it can't be good.') Today's Ricky was all about 'extreme breast makeovers', of course, they took other parts and pieces off the women as well... for the 'makeover part' I suppose. All the girls were in their mid 20s, would be my best guess.  Hell, one even had her boyfriend with her at her operation (and exactly why did she feel so insecure about the whole procedure??? was it him???) But they all made it sound like this was the best damn thing that they EVER did... and how much it increased their self esteem and gave them confidence... Some things that disturb me (beyond all the little girls at home watching how easy it is for them to change their body by knife for a new look), well what I just mentioned disturbs me too.  But with all of these makeover programs, is it any wonder why people are so disatisfied with themselves?  Playboy, Men'sIllustrated Swimsuit Edition... advertisements.  Is it any wonder how people can be so irrational if their nose has character, if they are tall, if they are short, if they are curvy.  Whatever happened to what's inside someone?  And women are just as bad, GQ, Mens Health... I know that I sneak a peak between the covers of those mags to see what's smoking once in a while. The truth that we all know... ok, maybe not until you are closer to your late 20s, or just \\x02EXTREMELY\\x02 insensitive, shallow or \\x02STUPID\\x02 ... once we get under that pretty wrapping, we taste something sweet, but soon begins to make us sick to our stomach.  Because the candy coating was all that there was... and if I can elaborate a bit more, sometime there is a stinking pile underneath it... (which can REALLY make you sick!) Ok, ok, I hear you... some simply WANT a taste... nothing else.  (but not most, not all)   Isn't it about time that we start learning to \\x14live\\x14 with who we are, and not the idea of who we someday hope to be?         \",\n",

This was my life, all my time,all my worthless fucking heart, This and the pipe, my only crime, but I was found guilty from the start, Back in one hour, Going into the light, I climb,  I play my part.  Here's my heart, I wear it on my sleeve, Always a man apart, always have I to solemnly greive, Back in a minute, I fly like a dart, I finally leave.  This is a note, written by a man who only used to be, Like the words that he wrote,  it's only a tale of what once was me, Back in due time, You all were so quick to demote, but am I blind?, or can I just not see?  Here goes the life, love, electric heartbeat,  goodbye, don't miss it, Don't even waste one woeful worrisome wooing cry, dismiss it, Back on Tuesday, maybe, I am the forgotten freak of a failure, so i'll fly,its not so sad,is it?  These are the words, on the note, that I leave on the front door, every single day, Except it shook me to my core to admit defeat, so ,back in 5 is all it'll ever say, Back in 5, Into some happy place maybe i'll float, and finally make the score,but I know what you all will always say.

Whether it was chance or that thing called fate that brought you to me I really can’t say and I don’t believe it really matters. For I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to have you anyway. And should the winds of time blow hard enough to take you from my thoughts, I can rest assure they will never take you from my heart. Life is a time for learning we must learn that our life is as important as that of any other person on Earth but never more important. I must learn that I have every right to happiness, yet it is up to me to find and recognize it. I must learn that Life is not easy nor is it permanent, others will come and go, and often their departure will cause me pain. I must learn to develop a positive attitude that can handle life's disappointments. And I MUST learn that in order to find love, I must look inside my own heart. For if I can't find it within, I will never find it without. Sometimes, I seem to take for granted the people I love the most... Those who are so important to my daily life; and, who are so important to me. It doesn't mean I don't care; and no DISRESPECT is intended...It is just that sometimes, life gets crazy and there isn't time to do it all, or say it all. Or like you say sometimes it is just not destined AT ALL. Especially today, I want you to know how much I appreciate the loving things you ever said, and how much I admire you for being the kind and giving person you are(that’s bullocks).I hope you know how very much I Love You...Not just sometimes, but ALWAYS. I do.  Happy Birthday!!!  P.S. (Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion just REMEMBER THIS)  And with this last mail the seven year relationship came to an end. To this day she can’t seem to find the right word to define it; so just, relationship! Yes, it is tragic that she was in love and it didn’t work out but she has to emotionally cut him out of her life and move on. And as they say the sooner the better...Their relationship was like a magnet they bonded like one and repelled like one too. And I guess it was time to repel now. Why do we let the one thing we don’t have affect all the things we already have? What did she get in reply to this mail?  Z man: Thanks. What did she reply in reply to this? Y girl: You are quite welcome. How did the general public review it as= thanks but no thanks attitude from Z man to Y girl. Another “End of the affair” The story doesn’t end here. This is just the beginning, as to whatever we think or plan goes exactly the way we haven’t planned it so why not hear this story the way you did not expect to hear? The other day I was talking to a friend and she was upset over her own personal affair so out of no where I saw this coming from her. EFG: Stay with who ever you are, by looking here and there you won’t get anything but instead will be biting dust. Remember what I just told you instead of fooling your self with writing such stuff leave this once a “Fairytale” and direct it all towards what you have. (Literal translation of Urdu)  Phew! So not only her … I see this as a latest form of SARS (Severe Acute Reverence Syndrome) taking place in all the females from age group 19 to 25. Though I do believe it invaded Earth long ago but may be then it was “HV” (Hanky-panky Virus) &“TB” (Tough luck Bug) From what I know this is not the age to fool around or do I have the wrong impression…In our part of the world if the female is getting involved at this age then it is strictly serious business. So why cant it be a calm sea, smooth breeze you know clear sky and no clouds for once? Why? Since in the US of A I have developed this habit of going to Starbucks every now and then and gazing at people as if they are not people and some cattle show. But its fun, just grab a frappuccino and that toffee caramel brownie and you are good to go for 2 hours or more. Sit there and read, if not in a mood to read then just look around and acquire or find out or make out…..oh no no no no no no not that make out...Wrong word. You’ll find your self looking at a few really nice round table conferences taking place. Either you’ll L or L (learn or laugh) depending on your level and attitude for acceptance. It was dewy out there, and the café corner was warm, clean and friendly, and I hung up my Nine West water-proof on the coat rack to dry and put my NW fish cap on the rack above the bench and ordered the usual. I collected it from the counter and I took out my journal from my hand bag, seated my self next to a bunch of people and started to write. Lucky me to get a seat right next to a rectangular shaped table this time. The topic under discussion was “Can a person fall out of love?” and guess what the first statement was, coming from a lady who was nearly around her 7o’s “It is possible because I believe that no matter how much you love a person, there’s always someone out there sick of that person that you are loving!” Interestingly I had never thought of it. I told you either you learnt or laugh, but I was experiencing both next was an old veteran and this is what he had to say “No, I don’t think it is possible to fall out of love, maybe your feelings will just subside. No matter what happens between two people you will always remember you felt for that person, and there will always be a special place in your heart for them.”  And the most appealing line came in at the end. I hope I never “fall out of love!” So it is not all that rough as we picture, it is out there.  Amongst the grey hair sat a Desi too and this is how she squirrel away her love story, “OF course you can fall out of love, especially if you go just on the emotions. I learnt it a long time ago that love is a choice we make. Sometimes I wake up and just don’t FEEL like loving my husband. Especially, when he does something very stupid or makes me mad. We have been married 15 years-we divorced briefly and then remarried. (Hmmm) It is a conscious choice we can make. Sure there are emotions involved, but in the maturing of a relationship, eventually those emotions evolve into companionship and being in tune with each other and each others needs, wants and desires. There are some times when I get those giddy goose bumpy feelings about my husband, but I look forward to the maturing process even more. So what I mean is, we do not fall in love as one may think Love is a decision; we make and let ourselves do. Yes, you can stop loving someone if you want to. Love is something we must work at to keep it strong. You get out of it what you put in to it!”  Well, (sigh) that was my reaction to this one and so I remembered “Marriages are made in heavens but again, so are thunders and lightning, tornados and hail.”  And with this I got a call from my husband who was waiting out side for his love, and affair to get started. As I moved out the sky was a lot clearer and the air more refreshing and I thought about that e-mail and just wished that Z man doesn’t fall out of love with Y girl, one of the wisest sayings I could think of, then; was “…love never dies…it simply changes forms…” I think once you have fallen in love, you can’t leave. Sure the feelings die when cold silence. But I think the person you love will always be in your heart. And whenever you see him/her your heart still thumps harder, and you begin to have subtle feelings- it is probably just you reminiscing about the past.   I thought maybe the past is like an anchor holding us back, maybe you have to let go of who you were to become who you’ll be.     \",\n",

Ygirl:So is there something you want me to ask you in particular...............Mr. Not Worth it and Mr. punctual!  Z man: Maim whatever you want to ask would be considered as 'your wish is my command.' Y girl: I asked so as you.....said you your self said, you’ll answer my questions from now onwards. Z man: Sorry it wasn’t for you. Wrong window. I am so sorry Miss Y for this indecent act of mine. Y girl: Should be Y girl: But vindication accepted Y girl: If I may ask who was it for, then. Z man: I am grateful. Miss Y has always been kind to this ordinary mortal. Y girl: So I have been…Sir! Y girl: The indecent act I am inquiring about here? Z man: It’s nice that you are extending the similar courtesy though very undeserved but her highness benevolence knows no bounds. Y girl: Oh, not at all sir answering back in the same conduct is my pleasure. Z man: Pleasing this person has always been your priority baroness Y.  Y girl): baroness? Now what on the earth does this mean? Z man: it’s an English title given to a woman. For men it is baron... Z man: should the baroness needs further explanation...Can ask  Y girl: I don't suppose baron........using it like this, is it the right way? Z man: I beg your pardon madam. Your last statement remains bit unclear for an ordinary mind like mine... Y girl: Exonerate me for such an immature act but you addressed yourself in a very polite manner..........it should have been for a “pea brain like me”...Instead Y girl: Mr. Z enough of this Y girl: I need to breath now Z man: Only if my kissing right restored. Y girl: Z man: no more kisses for you, you don’t deserve my kisses.................I abide by your wish SIR...or I should say Good Sir Y girl: and vice versa Z man: yes lady Y…that was my statement. I shall abide by it till death should you continue with the language that we have been using for our discourse.... Y girl: Nooooooo Z Z man: or else. I need the right to kiss and being kissed. Should you think it’s too much of a demand? I can still live. (For living without it is already destined and destinies can only be changed by the great ones and I am just a person living in this world till I complete my term)  Y girl: the crowning of this wishful thinking will be consummated when we ever encounter each other........ Y girl: That’s all I wish to say on this affair… Z man: our encounter seems to be tied up in knots for ever maim. We cannot meet...or else lady Y must have plans which are not disclosed Y girl: Further discussion on the account will bring more lacerate and nothing virtuous Z man: was I virtuous ever...I ask the lady... Y girl: what if the lady does not wish to answer Z man: then consider the question was never asked. Her majesty could turn down whatever she wishes to at will and stroke...in her kingdom its absolutism.

As me and my husband slowed down for a little fast food and to check our emails. Still a little dopey I looked around to find who could actually still talk no, no, no no not talk but actually chat in such an aristocratic manner that too in the Windy City. But to my dismay none around fit the script well. So I copy pasted and christened my inbox with this holy English rap session. Hushedly chuckled and walked out of the main door towards the Cheese Factory. As I past across the Magnificent Mile an unholy brain wave struck me. Standing in the waiting line for my turn to get seated I couldn’t stop thinking about time, was every second of our life controlled by fate. Or is life just a series of random occurrences? If Miss Y was by any chance ten minutes late to get online. She wouldn’t have ever run into Mr. Z. Is time every thing? While I was still debating silently in my mind my eyes caught a very charming girl sitting under the umbrella and talking to her friend “Like every women consumed with a relationship problem, I needed a project from obsessing and my hands from dialing his number. The moment I fixed the hands free set it was you on the other end. So here I am saved from the close call of calling him. Not bad timings this time.” I felt a curve on my face and I bet my eyes twinkled, for I was just in time to hear that. I gave way to another couple who was right beside me and thought enough cheesy thoughts on my behalf. Enough rats waiting to get in the rat race…so one out won’t make much of a difference. Tsk tsks see another cheesy thought!!! Walking towards my hotel I passed across the M.M again, but this time thinking, can you make a mistake and miss your fate? Got my self a cab and there it was right behind the drivers seat, “Which Tarot Card Are You?” CALL 1-tar-ots-card!!! And I thought to myself, just because fate doesn’t deal you the right cards, it doesn’t mean you should give up. It just means you have to play the cards you get to their maximum potential. With the cab meter passing its verdict $6.75 and myself having no change…I gave the cab driver a bill of $10. Through the partition as if a prisoner giving out a letter to send back home and politely asked him to keep the change!!! As I flung the door and shut it back. The driver lowered his window and said “We are no prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of our own minds. Thank you and you have a wonderful evening maim!” A spontaneous “You too!” springed up from my mouth. And I walked towards Hyatt’s main entrance I saw my reflection in the revolving door and the tilted crescent on my face that wrinkly forehead and those tipsy eyeballs and thought to my self, hmm WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO , YOUNG LADY!!!:)    p.s.

I took my brother and his friend for a matinee. In the middle of the movie it hit me, I was single for more than a year. I got depressed. I got so sad that I didn't leave home for two weeks. I didn't do anything to resolve my depression. I didn't date, I didn't try to. Now, I'm in the same position. I try now to know how I managed to believe all this weeks that I was ok, that I've moved on. I haven't. Situations like this one made me realize that it still hurts.  It's been long since. All this time I've tried to put my mind to work. I've tried to keep me so busy that the only way to go at the end of the day would be to sleep. I succeeded, at some level. Still, everything reminds me. Some smell, a movement, a dream ( those are the ones that hurt the most ), a word, a song. Now, what's the worst? The knowledge that I am the only one clinging to this, and is just stupid of me.  As today was watching SATC reruns, I cried like a baby. It felt good, but left me thinking. Was sincerity what I needed? I think it was. After all, I was feeling miserable for two weeks prior to 'the moment'. Would I go back? With cold head I'd say no. With heart, in a second. Even though I know it would've never worked. Somehow, and I don't know why, I think it was my fault. And maybe, well, not maybe, THAT is what's killing me. I keep roaming about everything, all the details. Damn my intelligence. I managed to know everything without even trying: mail accounts left opened, cell calls, etcetera. Still, I kept my mouth shut. Stupid of me. I just allowed myself to keep falling in love and then be crushed for two persons that don't deserve all this time.  I know I'm smart enough to get even. Heck, I'm smart enough to give enough pain. I love vengeance. But I love him. Slap me in the face, please.  In all this process, I may even treated some people the way he treated me, and I am so sorry for it. I know I'm not ready to date them, but not even as friends? Why do I have to hold back? Why do I have to make all this so complicated? Maybe, because I know now, this is the second time I've been in love, and the first time someone breaks my heart, on purpose.         \",\n",

In this series we are examining health care market in India, with special emphasis on how to make health care market to work for the poor.       Present Scenario:    ►Labyrinthine queues, indifferent staff, harried doctors, – the trademark of public healthcare facilities under the aegis of various governmental agencies.  ►Glass exteriors, sparkling corridors, state of art equipment, and presence of BIG money every where…. the private specialty and super specialty “Five Star Hospital.”  ► a small glass door, a poky passage… a few ill-equipped rooms, with astronomical charges, a busy doctor cum administrator (with some “friendly doctors” on the panel) discreet staff…that is your neighborhood nursing home.  ► the ongoing dispute between private medical college owners and the government, over quota, fee structure, capitation fee etc has characterized our medical education system in recent history.     2.    MAJOR ISSUES    Literature on public policy on health, with special reference to India, reveals that following issues have been attracting attention of policy makers.    Decreasing public (Government) expenditure on health --   a). Contribution of public expenditure in health in India has declined substantially since independence and today private expenditure is 87% of total expenditure while contribution of public expenditure is only around 13 %. The Human Development Report 2004 (Times of India, New Delhi, 28th July 2004) shows India ranks 171st out of 175 countries for whom data is available as far as public spending on health is concerned (0.9% of GDP). On the other hand, India ranks 18th out of 175 on private spending on health (4.2% of GDP).   b). Poor and inefficient delivery system in public sector. c). Rural - Urban divide in terms of facilities and availability of qualified manpower. d). Big infrastructure gap, which is highly skewed against rural areas. e). Issue of ethics in private sector.       3.  Present policy and status of human resource in health sector in India  .  The Annual Report of Ministry of Health and Family Planning, India, for the year 2001-2002 States as follows: -   “…In the past, during the 6th and 7th Five Year Plan periods, the policy of Government has been to  discourage  opening of new medical colleges in the country, as the existing medical colleges were considered to be sufficient to meet the medical manpower needs of the country.  This policy was reviewed after1991, when it was recognized that a large number of posts of doctors were lying vacant in many places especially in rural areas and there was tremendous pressure for gaining admission into medical colleges. As a result, new colleges were getting established even without basic requirements of infrastructure, equipment and faculty.In order to check the mushroom growth of medical colleges, the President of India promulgated an Ordinance on 27th August 1992 to amend the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. The above Ordinance was converted into an Act of Parliament on 2nd April 1993. The main provision of this Act relates to seeking prior permission of the Central Government before establishing an institution imparting education in medical sciences, increasing the intake of students or introducing a new or higher course of study.     After the enactment of the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Act, 1993 and the Regulations issued there under, the Central Government have permitted establishment of 37 medical colleges; 19 private sector and 18 in Government Sector till date. Out of 37 medical colleges permitted, 6 medical colleges were permitted in the year 2001 -2002.”     Even today if one sees how issues are being made of capitation fee, admission quota’s, fee structure etc involving high court and supreme court with out realizing that it is not helping cause of medical education or health care in the country.     What country needs badly is qualified doctors in hordes not in trickle.     From the above one can see that we have been and are still very negative when it comes to granting new medical colleges.  Even after realizing that there is shortage of professionals in the field    (Ref.: Review of 1991   ) the Government further centralized the process of allowing new medical colleges in the name of quality. It is not understood how transferring power of sanctioning new medical colleges from Medical Council to Central Government going to help in reducing shortage and improve quality?  Quality can be checked only by professional bodies like Medical Council and not by generalists. Such policies only delay the process and sends negative signal which discourages normal business people to come forward in this sector as its looks to be the exclusive field of few selected.  This attitude further helps the existing private colleges as they function in a protective environment where demand for admission is huge. This creates a hidden monopoly. Like any other monopoly created in private sector, this too is exploitative, which is reflected both in the exorbitant informal fee charged by them and in the quality of education imparted.  This also led to creation of another monopoly of private practitioners because of shortages of qualified professionals; as discussed later in Para 4b.    Status of supply of doctors in India.    A. Total number of doctors has gone up from 61,800 in 1951 to about 0.50 million in 2001. So on an average we have added 9022 doctors per annum during last 50 years. Presently we are adding about 17,000 doctors per annum.  B. India has 0.40 doctors per 1000 people as compare to 1.0 and 1.5 in  low-income countries and world average respectively (excl. India and china).   C. If India wants to reach status of low income countries or world average then we need to have 41,000 or 81,000 additional doctor per annum on an average against the present number of about 18,000.  The demand supply gap would be further accentuated when we take into account the long gestation period (almost 6 years) for educating doctors. This is based on following assumptions.  ● we are working for a period from 2004 to 2014. ● population in India to grow only by 15 crores in next ten years. And today’s population is taken as 100 cr only. So we will be working assuming Indian population to be 1200 million in 2004. (Very conservative estimate!!) ● no change in doctor population ratio in countries or group of countries with which comparison is drawn. ●another 80,000 doctors (assuming 20,000 addition annually since 2000) have been added to the medical pool in the country since 2000 so we take doctors figure as on today as 5,83,000. ●Including various types of practitioners in health field, the total number are expected to be around 11,00,000 in India presently. For our work, we have taken base figure of 5,03,000 qualified physicians as reported in the National Policy on Health, Indian Medical Council registration data etc. This tallies with the data available in the World Bank and WHO data bank. [1]   [  1]     The data for other countries for comparative purposes has also been taken from the World Bank and WHO data banks. Hence we are safely presuming that all the data considered here refers to qualified physicians only.      4. Human Resource in health sector -- our  view.     We consider human resource development (and more so qualified professional) as the key for any health sector strategy. We consider this as a key strategy for following reasons: -    A. Theoretical model.    We consider consultants (i.e. doctors etc) in the health sector as key element. We believe that it is around consultant health care revolves. We take medicine, undergo operation, tests, hospitalization etc all under the advice of consultant. This applies equally to both, rich and poor. Only the rich may consult the best professional whilst the poor may land up with quacks also.  Imagine following scenarios.           Situation A:   - Number of qualified doctors reduces over next few years in the country a.      Can health care grow under such situations? b.     Will service not go down while costs may go up? Space vacated by qualified people will be taken by unqualified. Reach of good qualified service will reduce. c.      Will it not increase rural /urban divide or rich/poor divide further? Obviously qualified doctors will move towards greener pastures i.e. urban areas and rich people; leaving the rural and poor people left with lesser or unqualified professional.           Situation B:   - Increased Public and Private Investment in health-care infrastructure without commensurate increase in   qualified professionals. a.    Will quality health care grow even after investment in infrastructure? b.    Will higher private investment in such situation not attract existing professional from less lucrative markets to more lucrative markets? In case of India this threat is a reality in view of India being marked as health tourism destination. c.   This will be further accentuated by increasing tendency of corporate to tap health insurance sector, which will tend to increase health care demand by rich sections. d.    Will not all these factors create a further vacuum in already scantily supplied rural areas? e.   Higher private investment as said above would increase urban rural divide while higher public expenditure, without commensurate increase in health personnel will only help contractors and suppliers. May also satisfy bureaucrats that they are able to obtain high grants for their department and able to spend it. but outcomes??            Situation C:   - Suppose we follow proactive medical education policy, which helps in increasing supply of qualified professionals.  a.      Cost and quality of medical service will improve as accessibility and choices will increase. b.     Increase supply of qualified personnel will push creation of other infrastructure facilities, which go with consultants.              Situation D  : - Visualize a fully furnished hospital without doctor, which can actually be seen in some remote govt. hospital. Simultaneously imagine a small room with a table/chair and a doctor. People will not go to such a furnished hospital and will prefer to go to the single room clinic.  The above analysis reveals that supply of qualified doctors is the key to any health sector strategy.  This is what we have admittedly neglected on one pretext or the other (e.g. National Policy in the 6th&7th plan to discourage medical colleges and subsequent centralization of power for granting medical colleges).    This could have been avoided if our policy on medical education was embedded in reality and we had allowed market forces to determine the demand and supply of qualified professionals, keeping the role of State restricted to the extent of regulating quality.  Till as late as the 6th and 7th plan we did not recognize the need for more doctors and when we thought there is a demand supply gap we strangulated the supply in the name of quality control, (centralization of power to open new medical colleges). Paradoxically we haven’t succeeded in that too.  Is this a case of judicious allocation of resources?     This is a result of lack of clarity on the roles and objectives. Our view is that welfare function of the state will be best served if we regulate the quality and leave quantity to be regulated by markets.     We may even add that markets are a good judge of quality too provided there are choices and no shortages.  It is well known that in eras of shortage bad quality also get absorbed. Quality is discounted or recognized with premium only when there is abundant supply, which provides options to people to choose from. Let us not forget that various brands are established in market. Let us not forget parents try to send their wards to best school, which they find out by word of mouth. Word of mouth is a system of communication, which is time tested but it will work only when you provide choices and no short supply.      B. Health expenditures in India: -    As per the established data about 87 % of health expenditure in India is in private sector (Source: World Health Report 2000). The trend has continuously been in favor of private sector since independence. This is one of the highest health expenditure in private sector in any country in the world.                          When we reflect on this we realize that in a situation where we have a shortage of key element of health system (viz. paucity of trained doctors) how can we expect good health care. Rather shortage means high price and bad quality. And if shortage is there in a situation where market is highly fragmented and mostly in private hands then it can be highly exploitative (it tends to become hidden private monopoly). It becomes highly regressive further for poor as he spends higher percentage of their income on health.  c  . Core health indicators and doctors: -    An Analysis of core health indicators vis-à-vis doctors number and per capita health expenditure in $ ppp terms in countries with similar level of per capita expenditure has been drawn by me and it shows direct co-relation between number of qualified doctors and core health indicators with expenditure being same. Country with low doctor population ratio even with high per capita expenditure fair badly when compare to countries with high doctors ratio on core health indicators.   d.   Indian health markets – booming?    Many market research organization have been burning mid night oil painting the possibilities of high growth in Indian health sector in future. It is expected that the market size will grow from about USD 20 billion to USD 46 billion by 2012(“Healthcare in India: The Road Ahead' by the CII and McKinsey & Company in 2002).  India is being seen as a heath tourism destination. This seems to be a reality too as Indian markets are relatively more cost effective as compared to international market keeping the quality constant. Indian health market is also, expected to grow because of expected increased penetration by health insurance.  These forces will push the demand for various types of health services and if on the supply side the key element (viz. trained professionals) is in shortage then the demand will remain unfulfilled causing shortages. This will lead to shifting of trained professionals from non-lucrative markets to lucrative markets, increasing scarcity in already neglected areas.  From the above we are convinced that supply of doctors is critical and the most important intervention for improving health cares in India.  5.        Strategy/ Recommendations      a. Introduce a diploma course in medicine of three years. The diploma will allow him to do limited clinical practice. A diploma holder will be entitled to take admission for a degree course only after doing two years field experience. The experience can be even free  lance practice.   b. State intervention only to check quality while granting medical colleges and that too by professional regulator like medical council. Bureaucratic and political involvement should be barred. Rules to be modified to take away the intervention of state /central govt. role and leave it only to medical council.  c. Leave the quantity to be decided by the markets.  d. Higher support to medical education by the State either by setting new colleges or if need be by supporting colleges in private sector monetarily. This will help in better utilization of public private funds and bring about public private partnership.  e. No need for the government to set itself the task of prescribing fee limits – once there is open competition, the market will ensure that these colleges only charge the fee that is commensurate with the quality of education they impart. This will actually spur private colleges to be recognized as centers of excellence as well. f. If state wants to provide support to certain sections of the society the state can reserve seats in public sector colleges (on the same lines as done today). Similarly in private medical colleges government can reserve seats to help certain sections of the society, but will pay fees on behalf of such students as any other regular student by providing budgetary support.  g. State based CET to be conducted under the supervision and guidance of the regulator and all admissions to be based on CET merit, which will have scope to discriminate, in favor of socially backwards by following existing system. Even colleges may be given permission to conduct their own entrance examination, as given to few government owned colleges. This will help in developing competition among them selves to attract good students to have a name for themselves. We may climb a new ladder in higher education.  h. No issue of capitation fee and quota in medical college etc.  6.       Advantages of this strategy       This policy shift will have the following advantages.  a. Expansion of health care services leading to better and cheaper services for all and there will be happy space for swanky hospital too!  b. This will provide more options to the patients and hence better bargaining power.  c. Will fulfill expectation of many students desirous of becoming doctors and provide them with choices. More medical colleges mean better bargaining power to the students / parents, both for fees and quality of education.  d. Will break informal monopoly created in medical education and in health sector in India, which is hampering better health care in the country.  e. As we have been saying in our various articles choices is key to success in any public policy. We believe so because choices provide scope for selection. Selection and only selection leads to evolution and that is change. It also empowers people as they apply their mind to choose from various options. Indian history is full of evidences where given the choice Indian people have shown how sensibly they have selected  7.    Success of this strategy:     Can relaxing norms help? Whether private sector will find it lucrative enough to enter health education market?  Let the market decide.    Sunil Porwal is an IAS Officer of the 1983 batch.

       " \"                                                                                                                 That double-header of a rover mission to Mars -- Spirit and Opportunity -- are both moving toward fresh rounds of science-gathering and could survive far longer than once expected. Opportunity at Meridiani Planum, has received the go-ahead to 'deep dive' into a large impact crater dubbed 'Endurance', while on the other side of Mars, the Spirit rover at Gusev Crater is within days of reaching the 'Columbia Hills' and studying geology that appears to offer unique insight into that region’s history. Meanwhile, scientists and engineers that operate the robotic twosome are looking at 'wintering over' schemes -- putting the mechanized explorers in hibernation mode, and then restarting their duties on Mars next spring. Mars rover scientists detailed future plans at last week’s American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting, held in Denver, Colorado. Taste-testing the hills 'Things are about to get very, very interesting,' said Steve Squyres of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and principal investigator for the science payload carried on each of the Mars rovers. At Gusev Crater, Spirit has been making remarkable progress driving toward the Columbia Hills. 'The hills are starting to get too big. So the images cut off the top of the hills…and that’s kinda cool,' Squyres said. Those pictures of the hills already reveal exposed bedrock and other features that look 'very interesting, indeed,' he added. 'We should pull up at the base of those hills within another week, or a little bit more. Then we’ll see what we see,' Squyres said. A preliminary plan is to have Spirit traverse southward, along the margin between the hills and the plains of Gusev Crater. A variety of geological features is in that direction. 'I don’t have high confidence to be able to climb high into the hills,' Squyres said. 'But as we get closer and closer…I can see that plan being altered significantly.' Squyres told the AAS audience that Spirit will first 'take a taste' of the hills with its science gear, 'then hang a right'. Exactly what the traverse will be like after that will be decided by what is found, he said. 'That’s what is interesting about this mission. You can’t plan too far ahead because Mars will surprise you,' Squyres explained. Enduring Endurance The Opportunity rover at Meridiani Planum is perched at the edge of the stadium-sized Endurance impact crater -- a feature roughly 65-feet (20 meters) deep and brimming with thick and old layers of bedrock and rich in sulfates, hematite, and basalts. Careful study has been done of a section of Endurance tagged 'Karatepe' -- a layered band of rock. That piece of real estate is seen by rover drivers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California as a safe entrance ramp into the roughly 430-feet (130-meter) diameter crater. This spot is less steep and more approachable than the rest of the crater’s rocky outcrops. 'It is a rocky surface, but there are these little spherules we call blueberries all over the place,' said Jim Bell of Cornell University and leader of the panoramic camera team for the Mars Exploration Rovers. Bell told SPACE.com that the potential risk of having Opportunity drive on a plywood-like surface covered with spherules acting like ball-bearings has undergone detailed assessment. 'The slopes are gentle enough. The rover wouldn’t go tumbling down the hill…but it would slide and be hard to control. You could get in a situation where you sit spinning your wheels trying to get back up,' he said. Big cliffs Squyres said Endurance crater is 'just a stunning, beautiful, spectacular place.' But such a hole in the ground 'can be a permanent rover trap,' he added, and 'a one-way trip doesn’t appeal to any of us very much.' 'This is a dangerous place for a rover. There are big cliffs that we could drive off and die. So we’ve been very careful here,' Squyres said. In going into the crater, and taking a prudent route, Squyres said that Opportunity would drive slowly forward with its robot arm stretched out, steer to a band of exposed rock, do its business and then back out, straight up the hill. 'The vehicle goes backwards as well as it goes forward,' Squyres pointed out. So far, so good Regarding the overall health of the twin vessels of Mars exploration, both robots continue to perform well. Several things could kill the rovers, such as a key electronic part failure or the wearing down of a critical mechanical piece of equipment. To date it has been so far, so good as the robots continue to march their way across the martian landscape. 'If both of those things hold out, then what is probably going to get us is dust build-up on the solar arrays,' Squyres said. 'Right now, we’re seeing a pretty sharp drop off in solar power on both vehicles. That’s a consequence of both the onset of winter and declining solar power because of the dust build-up.' Despite this issue, Squyres said rover engineers think the two robots will survive through the winter and to the next spring on Mars. Wintering over: spring back to life? Staying alive is tougher for Spirit than it is for Opportunity. That’s due to Spirit’s higher latitude exploration zone on the red planet, Squyres reported. 'We’re already looking at maps of the Columbia Hills and trying to pick a good spot to winter over,' he said. Part of the wintering over strategy will involve positioning the rovers to soak up as much continuous sunlight, even as the Sun moves low in the martian sky, Bell said. Secondly, the robots are to be oriented so that communications links with orbiters zipping overhead is maximized, he pointed out. 'It’s a combination of those two things -- finding that sweet spot,' Bell said. Coming out of hibernation mode in the spring, 'we’re looking at the final demise of these vehicles perhaps as late as the onset of our second winter on Mars,' Squyres concluded                    \",\n",

The control has the ability to automatically generate columns that are based on the structure of the data source. Auto-generation is the default behavior, but you can manipulate that behavior by using a Boolean property named AutoGenerateColumns. Set the property to false when you want the control to display only the columns you explicitly add to the Columns collection. Set it to true (the default) when you want the control to add as many columns as is required by the data source. The default algorithm for column generation creates simple data bound columns that use literal controls to display the contents of the corresponding data source fields. The DataGrid control supports additional column types that can render the column data so that it performs an action when clicked.         BoundColumn    Displays a column that is bound to a field in a data source. It displays each item in the field as plain text.    ButtonColumn    Displays a command button for each item in the column. The text of the button can be data bound. The command name of the button must be common to all items in the column. When the value for the command name is Select, clicking the column button automatically selects the row.    EditCommandColumn    Displays a button column that is automatically associated with the Edit command. This class receives special support from the DataGrid control, which is manifested as a redrawing of the clicked row using a template.     HyperLinkColumn    Displays the contents of each item in the column as a link. The link text can be bound to a field in the data source, or it can be static text. Also, the target URL can be data bound. Clicking a link column causes the browser to jump to the specified URL. This column class supports target frames.    TemplateColumn    Displays each item in the column according to a specified template, allowing you to provide custom controls in the column.     Regards ',\n",

       " \"                                                                                                       Walking in Abundant life     Our life is but a vapor.  We are passing through this world to enter into eternity.  Eternity can be a scary thing especially if what it holds for us is uncertain.  Fear is usually fear of the unknown.  Fear can paralyze us and keep us from knowing joy, happiness and contentment with who we are and where we are in life.   Life is a gift and we believe as Christians that God is the giver of this life.  Some of us would further define God in the person of Jesus Christ.  The Bible outlines a plan that God has given us so that we can walk in Abundant Life.   Lets examine some of the scripture that shows us what the bible says about Life and Death.      John 10:9 'I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.   10 'The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.   11 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.   John 3:14 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  15 'that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  16 'For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.   John 4:14 'but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.'   John 5:24 'Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.   John 7:14 For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.   James 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one;  14 but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.  15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.   The bible is our guide to life.  The bible is our source of originality.  The bible is our authority with regards to the beginning and end of life.  The bible is our guide to living a life of abundance through Christ Jesus our Lord.  Some folks believe that our existence was an accident and that we have evolved from being a cave man to a higher form of life.    I believe that each of us belongs to a global community called humanity.  I believe that God created man and that we are to worship Him.  I believe that God created us to enjoy those things that He has provided us with.  God created us and provided us with everything that we need in order to have abundant life.  I believe that God defines what our needs are through the pages of our bible.   I also believe that we have gotten our needs and wants messed up and our life has gotten out of balance.  I also believe that the evil of this present world has drawn some of us out and separated us from our full potential as Christians.     In an effort to pursue God we have set up different religions and religious denominations with unique definitions of behavior and religious requirements that are necessary in order to find God and have abundant life.    What does life consist of on a personal level?    Eating Sleeping Emotions Thought life Sexual needs Intellect Physiology Religion Personal hygiene Entertainment Education Sports Hobbies Children Work Relationships Perceptions  As Christians we have entered into a personal relationship with God through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  I am not speaking of an emotional guilt or reflex that causes us to behave religiously.  I am talking about our coming face to face with God of the universe because He revealed His plan for us through the reading of His word or by listening to His word being delivered to you through a sermon, bible study or personal testimony of another believer.  When we become Disciples of Christ we move from one relationship into another.  The bible says that we either serve the devil or we serve God.  We have allegiance to either one or the other.  We make a commitment to either one or the other.  We cannot serve God and Satan at the same time.  We have to make a choice that will have eternal circumstances.    Christianity is not a religious behavior but a way of life.  Our behavior does not define what Christianity is but our actions define how Christ has changed our lives from the inside out.   The difference between a religion vs. Christianity is a religion defines how we can become Holy enough to approach God while Christianity empowers us through the Holy Spirit to KNOW God on a personal basis and allows us to learn how to walk according to His will for our lives and our community.    Thanks to the Information Age we have more information available to us in real time than ever before.  Can you imagine that a world event sometimes took days, weeks or months to be reported to the rest of the global community?  Those were the days when we did not have tele-type, telephones, fax machines, computers, e-mail, satellite, pagers, or cellular communications.  How many of us know more about the bible and its doctrines than we know how to live our Christianity in a practical way?  Do we major in information gathering and minor in living the truth of Gods word?  Do we focus more on attending church, doing religious traditions, reading books about God, attend seminars than we do on learning how to live the life of a Christian?  If the answer were yes then I would believe that is the root cause for our failing to experience Abundant Life that Christ spoke of.    How many of us have the family bible sitting on our desk, end table or up on the shelf gathering dust?  The only time some of us open the bible is when the pastor or bible study teacher tells us to open it up and direct us to a chapter and verse.  Some of us treat our bibles just like we do the remote control for our TV sets.  We take out the remote from the package, put in fresh batteries and when we want to change the channel we punch the right buttons.  Has our Christianity turned into a series of bad commercials that we are frantically trying to flip through?  Are we hurriedly flipping through the abundant life that God has outlined in the pages of His word or are we taking time to absorb the information within the pages of His book?  We entered into a personal relationship with Christ, asked the Holy Spirit to enter into our hearts so we would have power on high and then we allow the cares of this world and the endless sin in our lives to drain the life right out of us.    If we do not feed our souls the word of God we will be like a ship without a rudder.  We will become like a ship without direction and no power.  The Holy Spirit within us will be quenched and stifled to the point that HE will be grieved.   The key to abundant life is a personal relationship with the God  (Jesus Christ) of our universe.  A relationship must be nourished and tended to on a daily basis.  If you are in a marriage relationship you understand how important it is to work at keeping that relationship healthy.  Relationships of all types require nurturing and that takes energy and focus.  Relationships take commitment and personal sacrifice.   The word of God, the power of prayer and the Holy Spirit and the people in Gods kingdom is what defines us as Christians.  Without those critical elements our faith would be powerless and useless.   The benefit of a relationship with Christ is abundant life, fulfillment and challenge.  God says in His word that He will write down our names in the Lambs book of Life and will allow us entrance to Heaven to worship Him for eternity.  We must choose to keep our commitment strong to which we are in the kingdom of God on a daily basis.   The bible says that we are to be in the world but not of the world.  Does that mean that we do not associate ourselves with people who do not subscribe to our faith in Christ?  Do we totally reject every single thing about our world and move into caves and become outcasts of society?  I believe that God wants us to be salt of the earth and the light of the world.  Our faith brings flavor and our life of integrity lights the way to the kingdom of God for all who will look.   Relationship evangelism is a key way in which we can get to know someone, show him or her that we care, live our life of faith in front of him or her without compromise and allow the power of the Holy Spirit to draw him or her to the kingdom.  We must learn how to love people and despise their sin.  We must despise their sin because we know that the consequences of sin is death.  We must learn how to show the love of God to people through mercy and compassion.   Chuck Swindoll stated in his book on Compassion that People do not care how much you know until you know how much you care.  Once upon a time I was zealous for God.  I was so zealous about telling people about the truth of Gods word that I sacrificed the love of God, compassion for people and mercy.  People need to know that God loves them.   People need to know that God is a God of love, mercy and compassion.  People need to know that God has given them a choice.  We must live our lives in such a way that people can clearly see their choices.    We must know HOW to LIVE out our faith in God in a real way for the world to see.  Our lives must be an open book so that our victories and defeats can reflect the power of God.  The following list will attempt to reflect some of our daily battles and some of our choices.     I recognize the benefits of growing in the knowledge of Gods word but I struggle in choosing to study Gods word.  I would rather watch TV or read a good book than study Gods word.   I want to be more like Christ in my thoughts and feelings but I find it difficult to get away from my old life habits and sin nature.  The old nature is too difficult to overcome sometimes.   I see a need to pursue God on a regular basis to grow our relationship but I tend to only seek Him when I am in trouble.   I find it difficult to make personal sacrifices that will benefit me in my Christian growth because it is so much easier to go along with the crowd.  My nature is to do what comes easiest to me instead of what is difficult.    I understand more about WHO God is to me but I am finding it difficult to translate His changes to me in a practical way.       I constantly find myself having to focus on my thought life and having to rebuke impure thoughts with regards to my fellow man.  I catch myself listening to others gossip and passing that information on through gossiping myself.    I have a problem with my temper and catch myself speaking sharply to my children or spouse.  I find myself sacrificing my relationships with people for the sake of pursuing personal wealth, status and power.   I find it difficult to reach out to others who are more needy than myself.  I catch myself focusing on my problems more often than not.  I find that it is easier to be critical of my pastor and the church I attend instead of taking the time to pray for the people and situations.   My addictions to food, sex, drink or drugs have robbed me of joy, peace and contentment.    As you can see this list could go on forever.  Now that we have scratched the surface with regards to some of the things that are affecting our ability to walk in abundant life lets look at some positive things that we can do in order to make wrong things right.  The problem with our lack of balance with regards to living out our faith is very similar to the problems that we have in our educational system of today.  Why are our schools releasing young people into society without the necessary skills that will enable them to be productive members of society?      A.Our children do not have a firm grasp on the fundamental basics, which include reading, writing and arithmetic.  Without the basic learning blocks how can we expect them to have the necessary skills for higher learning?  B.Our children attend battle zones for schools.  When we attended school our issues were talking in class and chewing gum and fist fights in the parking lot.  Our children have to endure an environment filled with violence because of drug abuse and kids carrying guns to school.    C.Our children are not receiving discipline at home and the school systems are forced to do what the parents are supposed to be doing to begin with.  How can teachers do what they are gifted to do when the children are not focused enough to do the work?  Living in an instantaneous society is not conducive to the kids taking the time to learn but would rather goof off and play.    D.Our children are subjected to teachers who are not committed to teaching.  It is hard to get an education when school systems are not willing to provide a work environment that rewards teachers for the sacrifices they make.  That drives teachers out of the classroom into other occupations that pay more.   Now lets look at how people have gotten out of balance with regards to experiencing Abundant Life that God has for us.    We have not learned the basics of our faith.    Scripture memorization, regular bible study and becoming knowledgeable about basic bible doctrine have left us weak and vulnerable to our enemy who is Satan.   The bible says this about our enemy.  Peter I 5:7 Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you.  8 Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour.  9 Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experience of suffering is required of your brotherhood throughout the world.  10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you.   We have forgotten that Satan is the enemy of God.  That means that YOU are the enemy of God.  Satan will drag you into the pits of Hell with him IF you allow yourself to be taken.  Satan is the great deceiver and has the ability to deceive people IF they are not preparing their minds with the truth of Gods word.  The bible says in the book of Hosea.   Hosea 4:6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being a priest to me. And since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your children.   This is what the bible says about the IMPORTANCE of reading Gods word.   Hebrews 4:11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.  12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  Timothy II 2:14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.  15 Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.  16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.   We carelessly place ourselves in the middle of the minefields of life and wonder why we get our toes blown off.    We forget whom we belong to and we continue to act as if nothing has changed when we enter into a personal relationship with Christ.  We look to God as a puppet that we can manipulate when things go wrong but the rest of the time we leave Him on the shelf.  We entertain our minds and bodies with the cares of this world, which have no eternal meaning and lose out as we rush past the golden nuggets of a life filled with faithful obedience to Christ.  Our walk with Christ should be one of discipline, focus and diligence.   There is an old saying that says, Birds of a feather flock together.  We must learn how to associate ourselves with Kingdom Kids.  We need to seek out a good bible teaching church with people who are REAL about their relationship with God so that we can LEARN and GROW in our faith walk.  If we expect the power of God to be transferred into our lives and to give us REAL power so we can experience abundant life then we are going to have to place ourselves in the right environment for it to happen.    We run from discipline.    We live in an instant generation where we do not have to wait for anything.  We want it and we want it right now.  If you want something you do whatever you can to get it NOW.   Buy now and pay later is our motto.   In 2nd Corinthians we see the bible telling us therefore if any man be in Christ he is a NEW creation, old things pass away and all things become new.  We seem to think that our sinful nature is going to magically disappear and that we are going to completely and automatically bury our sin nature and that our NEW man (spirit man) is going to naturally spring forth.  We forget that there is a constant battle raging within our souls as the flesh competes with the power of the Holy Spirit that Christ places within us.  When we do something that we like we find out very quickly that we must discipline ourselves to learn HOW to get better at doing it.  If you like to bowl and you want to get better then you have to discipline yourself to learn HOW to approach the line and release that bowling ball in such a way that you can hit the head pin and knock down everything at once.  If you do not get it right then you will see that you are off balance and the ball will not hit the mark and then you will have to try it again.  We must determine to be disciplined in order to read Gods word and understand How to apply biblical principles to our lives.    We are powerless because we do not pray.    If you love someone you spend time with them and you talk with them and you share your heart with them.  You share your deepest secrets with them and you listen to what they have to say.  You learn how to become intimately involved in everything that they do and say.  Our relationship with God should be the primary relationship where we learn how to be intimate with regards to who we are in the kingdom of God and what God wants to share with us.  If you do not have quiet time where you can speak to God and LISTEN to what God says back to you then you will lack power in your life.  There is NO WAY that a professing Christian can overcome sin habits or addictions in their life if they are not willing to take the time to have intimate and regular conversations with God.  Only God can change you from the inside out.  Your pastor cannot do it.  Your spouse cannot do it.  Your children cannot do it.  Only GOD can change you into the image of WHO HE wants you to be.  God desires for you to have a CLOSE relationship so that HE can reveal who HE IS in the world around you.  You cannot get what God has to offer if you only talk to Him when you are desperate for your problems to be solved.    We are vulnerable because we separate ourselves from the body of Christ on a regular basis.   God designed relationships for a purpose other than for us to have an avenue to populate the planet. Have you ever asked a child who God is?  More often than not they will tell you His name is Jesus.  If you ask a child where God is they will probably put their hand over their hearts.   Children know that the kingdom of God resides in our hearts.  God made us to worship Him and he created us with a void in our hearts and souls that only He can fill.  The kingdom of God is all around us in the people who love Him and call Him the Lord of their lives.   No man is an island and we NEED to be around people who have the same faith beliefs that we do.  We need to be around people that think and feel and believe just like we do.  We draw strength and assurance from one another and we can help each other to be accountable for the integrity of our walk with Christ.    We need close personal relationships with other believers so that we can learn from one another as we share our victories and defeats.  This will require that we let down the walls of our hearts and be real with one another.  This will require that we commit to being a person that someone will be safe sharing their heart with.  So many folks have been burned and hurt because a careless tongue broke confidentiality.    We cannot experience Abundant Life that God intends for us to have when we fail to fully embrace the spiritual gifts that He has given us.   God gives us faith so that we can believe.  Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  We can believe in who God is because HE gives us the spiritual ability to believe through faith.  Hebrews 11:6 says 'But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.'     Corinthians I 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.  2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.  3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.  4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.  5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.  6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.  7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.  8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;  9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;  10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:  11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.  12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.  13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.  14 For the body is not one member, but many.   Did you know that God has given you a spiritual gift?  Do you know what that gift is?  Have you ever been challenged to find out?  Do you think that you can be a part of Gods plan to reach the world for Christ or minister to the body of Christ around you without God equipping you for the task?  Spiritual gifts do several things.     Glorify God and His Kingdom  Minister to the needs of the world around you  Convict people of sin in their lives  Causes healing and restoration  Brings forth Gods word  Defeats Satan who is your enemy  Gives Abundant Life to those who use them   We sometimes experience failure and defeat because we need to allow God to develop the fruit of the spirit in our lives  How will people KNOW that we are Christians?  They will know us by our Love for one another, God and our spiritual fruit. Have you ever gotten zealous for God and gone off half cocked?  Our intentions are good and we mean well.  The only problem is we are not prepared for some of the battles and challenges of life because God is not finished with us yet.  Growing in grace and maturity takes time.  There is no substitute for Gods timing in our lives and the discipline to be obedient to His word.  Lets examine the fruit of the spirit according to what Gods word says.  Matthew 7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.  21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:   Galatians 5:21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.  22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,  23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.  24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.  25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.     Do we have a right to judge whether or not someone is a true Christian? I would say a resounding no. Only God truly knows our hearts.  Do we have the ability or right to be fruit inspectors?  Yes, we can see how folks live their lives and if they are Disciples of Christ we will see evidence of this through the fruit that God will produce in their lives.  The following statements are Spiritual Confessions of Gods Abundant Life.  I got these from the back of one of the church handouts at Abundant Life Church in Houston Texas.    Please allow me to encourage you to embrace each one of these confessions.  These confessions are biblical in nature and God has provided them for us in His word so that we can be strengthened and encouraged in times of trouble.   Life is full of challenges.  Life is full of victory and defeat.  Life is full of pain and anguish.   Bad things can happen to good people as well as bad.   Our Joy of the Lord MUST be our strength and we can not allow the circumstances of this world to rob us of this joy or Abundant Life.     I am not under guilt or condemnation There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus  Satan is a liar; I will not listen to His accusations  No weapon formed against me will prosper  I will confute every tongue rising against me in judgement  My mind is being renewed by the Word of God, I pull down strongholds  I cast down imaginings; I bring every thought captive to the obedience of Christ  I am accepted in the beloved  If God be for me, who can be against me?  Nothing can separate me from the Love of Christ  I am NOT a slave to SIN  I am a slave of God and a slave of Righteousness  I am delivered out of the Kingdom of darkness  I am now part of the Kingdom of God  I do not have to serve sin anymore  Sin no longer has dominion over me  Satan is defeated  The Son of God came into the world to destroy the works of the devil, No longer will he oppress me?  I defeat him by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of my testimony, loving not my life unto death.   I submit to God, I resist the devil and he will flee from me.  No temptation will overtake me that is not common to man.  God is faithful, he will not let me be tempted beyond my strength but with the temptation will also provide a way of escape that I may be able to endure it.   I will stand fast in the liberty with which Christ has made me free  Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty   The law of the Spirit of life in Jesus Christ has set me free from the law of sin and death.   I will reign as a king in life through Jesus Christ  I am strong, the word of God abides in me, and I have overcome the evil one.   I am more than a conqueror through Christ who loves me  I am an overcomer  I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me  Thanks be to God who gives me the victory through Jesus Christ my Lord  I give no place to fear in my life, the fear of man brings a snare, but perfect love casts out fear.  I sought the Lord and He heard me and delivered me from all my fears  The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear.  The Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid  God is my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble therefore I will not fear.  If I were still trying to please men, I should not be a servant of Jesus Christ  But I am a servant of the most high God.  I fear not, for he is with me.  I shall not be dismayed, for he is my God.  He will strengthen me, he will help me, he will uphold me  With his victorious right hand.  I am not ashamed of the Gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation to those who believe  I am a minister of reconciliation  I am an ambassador for Christ  I received power when the Holy Spirit came upon me to be his witness  His word never returns void but always accomplishes the purpose for which he sent it  I am righteous, therefore, I am bold as a lion  He will never fail me nor forsake me, therefore, I can boldly say, The Lord is my Help, I shall not be afraid.  What can man do to me?     James Moffitt Jesus Connect Ministries http://www.jesus-connect.net jcmoffitt@jesus-connect.net          \",\n",

Does that mean I've got a crue-cut now? No way! It's still long - waaay over the collar, just a lot tidier. Ahhh - you gotta do these things every now and again. I think the last time I cut a big length like this was back in 2001 or 2002 - I can't remember. But all I've been doing lately is just clipping a cm off now and again, to stop those dreaded split enz! Argh! Gesus - I'm 40 now. I shouldn't still have bleedin' long hair at this age, should I? Not when it reaches half-way down your back, anyway. Now it's much more manageable. But, all the same, I bet I wake up tomorrow and brush my hair and go, 'Holy shite, what have I  done ?!?' pmsl!

Does that make it classical music yet? Thoon is dancing to Crowded House at the mo - he's smiling thru a nice clean tank this arvo too.

Bishop Nestorius labeled the humanity and the divinity as persons (prosopon) and taught that the two persons of Christ were joined by will without communication idiomatum (communication of attributes). 1 Abbot Eutyches  who was a well known monk who lived in Constantinople subscribed to this teaching later called Monophysites from their belief that the pre-incarnated Logos had only one nature but got a second one in its post incarnation status.    Nestorianism was condemned in the Third Ecumenical Council in Ephasus and  was deposed as bishop of Constantinople. Abbot Eutyches was also condemned  in the Fourth Ecumenical Council in Chalcedon.   Cyril: The Chalcedon Ring Leader  Saint Cyril of Alexandria’s Christological formulation was accepted as orthodox at the expense of the one formulated by Abbot Eutyches and Bishop Nestorius. A letter to Nestorius, St. Cyril wrote, in defense of his Christological position, “Thus we will confess on one Christ and Lord, not that we worship a man together with the Word in order that an appearance of division may not be introduced by saying with.”2  In an apparent exaggeration to embarrass his adversaries, St. Cyril continued to say “Therefore, the one Lord Jesus Christ is not to be divided into two sons”3! Needless to say, neither Abbot Eutyches nor Bishop Nestorius ever spoke about two sons in the Lord of Jesus Christ! The Coptic and the Syrian churches lashed out at the Chalcedonian Christology of what later became the Byzantine churches.    St. Cyril and his friends, including the Pope Celestine I, seemed not to interest in Scriptural debate about the issue at hand. They merely saw themselves as the protectors of the apostolic faith. A letter from Pope Celestine I to St. Cyril indicates this “It is necessary both to understand clearly and to remember that one must flee rather than seek foolish questions which do not promote the health of souls but proceed to their destruction.”4  But Saint Cyril occasionally exegetes the Scripture to support his position.  On page 83 of the same book, he outlines his understanding of  Philippians 2:7-8 in support of his two nature Christological position, he writes “We say that the flesh was neither turned into the nature of the divinity, nor, indeed, that the ineffable nature of the Word of God was altered into the nature of the flesh, for he is immutable and absolutely unchangeable, always being the same, according to the Scriptures.”5    The Chalcedonian Confusion  Chalcedon did great harm to the church as the schism it caused still persists. The  orthodoxy of the augmentation of the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed is also questionable in the light of the NT. This augmentation forces one to categorize the activities of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, to fit in one of his natures—either the divine or the human. The NT account of Jesus contradicts such dichotomy. In the whole NT, no where is Jesus shown to possess all the divine attributes (like omniscience, omnipresence) that the Chalcedonian augmentation attributes to the  earthly Jesus.6  For example, Jesus confesses his ignorance about the parousia “ No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” Matthew 24:36. How then can we take the Chalcedonian statement face value that attributes to him all the-time-omniscience?  One may be tempted to say that Jesus is here speaking from the perspective of his human nature; problem number one, there is nothing in the text to indicate that; problem number two, to say so is to affirm Nestorius’ schizophernic Jesus with two separate natures, persons, wills—each one independent from the other. Nothing is closer to the truth than to admit that the earthly Jesus was not omniscient. Jesus’ deficient omniscience is also seen in Luke’s description of the Child Jesus “And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men.” Luke 2:52. To say that Jesus grew in wisdom, for example, is to say that he lacked it in full measure in the first place for one cannot grow in something he already had in full measure.   The Kenosis and the Chalcedon  The Kenosis passage (Philippians 2:5-7) is one of the most polished and most beautiful passages of all of the Pauline epistles—if not the entire NT. The proper question in this connection is, of what did Jesus empty himself? The earthly Jesus temporarily and willfully emptied himself some of the divine attributes of his pre-incarnation deity.  The Kenotic interpretation should never be seen as an unbiblical compromise to the immutability of God. However, the incarnation itself necessitates some form of divine mutability on the part of God in a way that best suites him.   As one writer put it, “The Kenotic theory is often opposed on the grounds that it necessitates a change in the being of God. It is said that to assert that Jesus gave up any of the divine attributes is to deny the immutability of God. But if it is true that God is immutable in an absolute sense then there cannot be incarnation. But the Scripture reveals that God became man, that he moved from one state of being into another state of being—‘that the Word became flesh.’ The Word was not always fresh; it became that which it was not. In the incarnation the Logos , the divine Son of God, was changed from an eternal state of being as co-equal with the Father to a state of being in time and space in which he took the lowly state of man. In this state, Jesus became ‘less than the Father”7 (cf. John 14:28)  The Coptic churches do not call them selves Monophysites but non-Chalcedonian. Their Christology regarding the nature (s) of Christ is very sophisticated and hard to nail down.  “The Oriental Orthodox churches affirm one united Divine-Human nature, will and energy in the same Christ without confusion, without change, without division and without separation from the very moment of His descent to the Virgin’s womb where He took to Himself from her a human body with a human rational soul and made Himself  one with the manhood which He took from her as formulated by Cyril with such words One Incarnate nature of God the Word.”8  The Eastern Orthodox Churches affirm a Christology slightly different from that of the Oriental. The Easterners affirm “Two natures [,] two will and two energies hypostatically united in the one Lord Jesus Christ.”9   Conclusion  The way Chalcedon handled the relationship between the divine and the human nature of Jesus was nothing less than a disaster. The Chalcedon statement (the augmentation of the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed) may have come out of good heart in an attempt to safe guard the apostolic orthodox faith but it did not succeed well enough as the church is still divided and the its orthodoxy is highly questionable. Further more, the Fathers could not avoid using some Hellenistic Greek terminologies which did not have biblical background, for example, “Theotokos,” hypostasis,” and “ousia.”    This Chalcedonian statement highlighted the Oneness of the Person of the incarnated Son of God as underlined by the repeated use of the word the “same.” This Alexandrian background lends lenience to the Antiochenes by its use of “coalescing” to explain the union of two natures. It is sad though that this Council which brought together Western and Eastern traditions also marked the first visible division of the Church as the Alexandrians (Orthodox) churches do not recognize it to this day.

It was a 7 hour drive to get to my grandparent's farm. We had to wake up a 4:30 in the morning. Then we drove out to a field where we were debriefed, but honestly I have no idea what was said. It sounded something like this.  'So you two gotta walk the third to the second yonder draw over past the drag fence up there, but don't cross the adjacent fence which flies down on the opposite ridge, cause McWagoner's already cut the double flip-flop and we're hoping the herd is north by west-south. Thats why Kent here is circling back when the ball drops, if that happens you'll have to tell us because I'll be gunning the rig back to and forth along the gully-line and Jackson's creek. So the whole point is to re-align the fee-fi-fo-fum, to catch the overflow and head'm off with a box-in and if need be a second banger-rang. Just don't forget the banger-rang.'  I decided that all concludes to 'Go stand on a hill, and if you see a deer you should either shoot it or not shoot it, depending.'  So me and my Dad spotted all these deer, but we couldn't tell anyone cause the radio went of range. So we didn't shoot them, and they ended up going over our 'draw' further down where Ed was. And then we shot them. We stood around and shot deer... we really didn't even have to move that much. There were no line of sight obstructions besides the hills, the deer didn't really stand a chance because I saw groups of hunters on every hill for miles around.  We had 8 tags, and ended up with 9 deer by 9am which I guess is phenominal and never happens. But I was still sorta bored. I had fun because it was all new, but if I went again that wouldn't really happen cause I guess most hunting trips are just walking around for a long time... which is almost as boring as standing around.  I told my Dad that I didn't understand the challenge behind the hunting, because putting a scope on a deer and pressing a trigger is really easy, and the only way you find them in the first place is half by luck. He talked about how men have always hunted and such, but I wasn't buying it cause men haven't always had high powered scoped semi automatic 7.62mm rifles, and 2 ton Ford Trucks to carry the dead stuff and the night-vision goggles and the anti-phermone spray to cover your scent.   If I go next year I might as well just bring some hand grenades, and maybe a launcher for them. That way you could get dozens of deer at once right over the hill. I mean, its not like anyone really even needs the meat anyway you know?   Or even better, just put a lazer on a satillite and hit them from orbit. Enough of the line-of-sight crap! Just set up a laptop out there with a little portible dish and look for heat signitures. Then you could charter a helocopter to go pick up the carcuses, and they'd already be cooked for Ma.  So anyway, to avoid the hunting regulator people since we had a deer with no tag, we drove back through the hills cross country style and it took us an hour. Thats bumpy stuff to, since of all cars 4x4 trucks for some reason have the worst suspension (IT MAKES NO SENSE).     ---------------------------------- 'I heard if you play a Window's 98 CD backwards, it says satanic messages.. thats nothing, if you play it forwards it installs Windows.' - some guy somewhere that once said it  notes: Eric is starting a movie review segment of the site, since he's great at that... annndd James is helping me with thumbnails for the pics.

Reporting Services includes six rendering extensions: HTML, Excel, Text, XML, Image, and PDF. Developers can create additional rendering extensions to generate reports in other formats. The following sections describe the rendering extensions provided with Reporting Services..       HTML Rendering Extension:       When you request a report from the report server, either through a URL or Report Manager, the report server uses the HTML rendering extension to render the report.      Depending on the browser you use, the HTML rendering extension renders reports in either HTML 4.0 or HTML 3.2. Supported HTML 4.0 browsers include:       ·             Microsoft® Internet Explorer for Windows versions       ·             Netscape Navigator for Windows version 7.1      HTML 3.2 is used for all other browsers that support HTML, such as earlier versions of the browsers mentioned previously and Internet Explorer for Pocket PC. The HTML rendering extension generates all HTML using UTF-8 encoding.      The HTML rendering extension supports the MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents (MHTML) standard. The rendering extension embeds resources such as images, documents, or other binary files as MIME structures within the report HTML, in a single file. The encoded resources within the report increase the size of the report, but embedding the resources is useful for clients that do not have access to resources stored on the report server or in another location. MHTML reports are also useful for embedding within e-mail messages, because all resources are included with the report.       Excel Rendering Extension:       The Excel rendering extension renders reports that can be viewed and modified in Microsoft Excel 2002 or later. This rendering extension creates files in MHTML, which carry a MIME type of ms-excel and contain HTML meta tags and XML data islands that are specific to Excel. While the Excel rendering extension renders HTML, the rendered report is intended to be viewed in Microsoft Excel, not in a browser.     Resources, such as images, are embedded within the report. For more information about designing reports for the Excel rendering extension, see Designing for Excel Output.       CSV Rendering Extension:       The Comma-Separated Value (CSV) rendering extension renders reports in comma-delimited plain text files, without any formatting. Users can then open these files with a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft Excel, or any other program that reads text files.     For more information about designing reports for the CSV rendering extension, see Designing for CSV Output.       XML Rendering Extension:       The XML rendering extension renders reports in XML files. These XML files can then be stored or read by other programs.     The XML generated by the XML rendering extension is UTF-8 encoded.       Image Rendering Extension:       The Image rendering extension renders reports to bitmaps or metafiles. The extension can render reports in the following formats: BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and WMF. By default, the image is rendered in TIFF format, which can be displayed with the default image viewer of your operating system (for example, Windows Picture and Fax Viewer). You can send the image to a printer from the viewer.      Using the Image rendering extension to render reports ensures that the report looks the same on every client. (When a user views a report in HTML, the appearance of that report can vary depending on the version of the user's browser, the user's browser settings, and the fonts that are available.) The Image rendering extension renders the report on the server, so all users see the same image. Because the report is rendered on the server, all fonts that are used in the report must be installed on the server.       PDF Rendering Extension:       The PDF rendering extension renders reports in PDF files that can be opened and viewed with Adobe Acrobat 4.0 or later.      Other than these types, you can develop your own format by extending reporting services rendering extension.           Regards       Mitesh Mehta                              \",\n",

I can still remember the very first time I met him - I held him in my arms, and promptly burst into tears! It was a whole mixture of joyful emotions all overwhelming as soon as I held my first-born son! Sigh! Precious memories!    Yesterday I met the boys for a brief afternoon tea after school. Of all the little bits and pieces I got for Josh, while he loved the Shannon Noll CD (gaps! lol), the thing that grabbed his attention the most was a tiny transistor radio I got for free from the supermarket last week! He's excited that he can listen to the radio with the earplugs while he's riding his bike, and on the schoolbus! hahahaha! All three boys said they knew all the words to Shannon Noll's single 'What About Me' (which I remember when the original actually came out - I even saw Moving Pictures play live at my local pub!!! lol)... but, all they knew was the first words, 'What about me... mmm mmm mmm mmmmm...' pmsl! Boys will be boys. Nevertheless they popped it straight into the car's CD-player, and I'm sure my poor ex will be driven mad with endless replayings of the thing for the next few months! lol.    I had to laugh getting the Shannon Noll CD for him. (For those of you who don't know, Mr Noll was the runner-up at the last 'Australian idol' competition). He does nothing for me, and my flatmate and I had a huge laff when I told her I brought it. I told the girl at the checkout, 'This is not for me, really!' But she smiled and probably thought, 'Yeah, right!' It must be revenge from my own parents... they brought me a 'Sherbet' LP for my 11th birthday (which I'm proud to say I still have!), and I'm sure their reaction was exactly the same as mine was to buying Shannon Noll for my own son...

When the list of items become considerably large it starts hitting the performance and increasing the traffic between client and server... To avoid this set the EnableViewState property of the control to be false... By this unnecessary data will not move back and forth to the server... Though, do note that by doing so your selected items will no longer remain selected after postback and you will have to write special code to achieve this functionality... The same problems are also faced in controls like Datagrid so do ensure that you use View State judiciously and give enough thoughts while designing your application...  To see the view state of a page right click on displayed page and 'view source', here you will see a long line of junk characters for __VIEWSTATE property... This is the encrypted view state of your controls... Well, that makes me add one more point the performance... All the viewstate data that passes to and comes back from server goes through the cycles of encryption and decryption which in itself is also a costly affair hitting performance...

Also watched 'The Gift' today (the flatmate's DVD collection is getting a bit of a workout)... good film, well shot etc. I don't usually like these sorta films, but this one's pretty good. Also saw 'Rob Roy' which was about a 2 out of 5. Beautifully shot, and that's about the best part of it!!!   \",\n",

The water is unlike anything I've ever seen before - almost satin. So, that adds upto 9 books I received for my birthday this year - 6 by George Johnston, 1 by Robert Lowell, and 1 on Greece!

It's kinda a legendary thing - stuff I haven't seen before, and believe me I've seen a  whole lot  of stuff about The Beatles over the years! It's an official Apple documentary from their first visit to the USA in February 1964 by the Maysles Brothers, called ' The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit ' (Apple 07243 599360 9 3). It's a pioneering documentary as well, and it's got some great laid-back behind-the-scenes footage of The Beatles just hanging out, and their very first live gig and TV appearances in America - historic stuff. It hasn't been released since it was first showed in 1964 (was released afresh last year, 2003). Wow - even after 40 years, this stuff is still wonderful. Their Washington Coliseum gig is just pure  magic . There are moments when they share glances between each other during the gig, and you can tell by the looks on their faces and in their eyes that they're thinking, 'Wow! We're really  are  playing - in  America !'   \",\n",

As I slipped off my trakkies, I could have sworn I saw little sparks flashing in the darkness about my legs. For a split second I thought I'd totally lost it, or was having some nasty flashbacks from my late-teenage years or sommat! But, I did it again - slipped the trakkies down my legs, and - bingo! The static electricity was seriously causing tiny little flashes across my legs in the darkness! I'd never seen anything like that before - I felt like a kid making a new discovery! So, if you've ever got nothing else to do, in the middle of the night, get your eyes used to the dark, and try it with some staticcy clothes you've got. Zap!

My mind was 100 miles away, thinking dark cloudy thoughts, as such. I noticed 2 people get into a car parked outside a house about 50 feet in front of me, but didn't think any more of it. Suddenly, when I drew parallel to them in the car, a huge barked WOOF roared out from behind a closed gate from the right in the darkness. I literally jumped sideways, nearly tossing the blasted shopping trolley onto its' side. In my muttered cursings of being brought back to my senses from my reverie, I looked at the woman sitting in the passenger seat, and she was wetting herself laughing. Well, I couldn't help but laff myself - it must have looked pretty funny. I laughed all the way home.   \",\n",

The castle was built far away from civilisation and surrounded by walls and then locked up. The key was thrown away just so red death wouldn’t get in but red death got in anyway and trapped every one else in there. Red death killed 22 actors, 29 chefs, 30 cooks, 100 civilians, 20 rich people, the queen and Prince Prospero. Police discovered this misfortune early yesterday morning when a erldely civilian that lived in the area was walking past, noticed it was quitter than normally. Doctors arrived after the police had got in and noticed that the daises that killed all of these people was a disease called red death. News reporters say that if they weren’t locked up in the castle, and they were able to get out then they probably would of lived or at least saved a few people. Police are saying now that there is know one to blame except prince Prospero. Red death has now killed over 60,000 people. And red death is now one of the most deadly diseases a person is able to get. So if you know any one living near or has red death please warn them about it. And do not lock yourself in a building that is near red death. To tell if you have red death look for red blood pouring out from places like the face, legs, arms, eyes and feet etc. it takes 10 minutes at least to kick in so beware and stay away from red death or you could be or end up like one of the 203 killed in prince Prospero’s castle.

I grew up in Sydney, and if you were able to get a 2-week borrowing limit for a handful of items, you were lucky. Here, you can borrow upto 50 items for 4 weeks - for free! Amazing. Plus they have a great range of CD's, DVD's and videos too. On Monday I borrowed a few things from there...        Mental As Anything, 'Beetroot Stains'   (CME 2000) - I heard this CD by this old classic pub-rock Aussie band about 2 years' ago, but I didn't get a good listen of it. I wasn't very impressed with it then, but I thought I'd give it another listen. Yup, I was right - I'm still not impressed with it! It sounds like it's a band demo recording! Weak songs, nothing really catchy (like you'd expect from the Mentals). There's only 2 songs I prefer, the 2nd one 'Special Filter' (and then only 'cause it's got a good groove happening), and No. 6 'Narelle' (a funny story of an Aussie BBQ gone wrong...).        'The Truman Show'   DVD, with Jim Carrey. This is one of those films I've never quite gotten around to watching yet, so I thought I'd borrow it. I'm not really a Jim Carrey fan, yet he hits the spot in this thing. I like this film. Great concept (I love the light falling from the sky, the early sunrise, smashing his boat thru the horizon, the guy jumping out of the Xmas present, the sky-diver...), and well filmed, if a bit artificial. But, hey, the whole things' supposed to be artificial, so that's probably a good thing, hey? Good for a laff.      And finally... something on a totally different track (And now for something completely different...?) Ken Burn's documentary on the American  Civil War . Now, I am definitely NO fan of war, but for purely the historical interest in the thing, this is great. What a waste of bloody life. It's hard to imagine living in a time like that, as a country literally tries to tear itself apart. Australia's never had anything remotely like that happen to us in our brief life - all our fightings' been for bloody someone else! pmsl! It's hard to imagine all those men dying on battlefields in such lovely quiet little country spots like Gettysburg. Madness. Pure madness. But, like I said, I've never had to live thru anything like that - a nation going thru it's growing pains so rebelliously. Australia's growing pains all seem to be expressed internally. Yet they are just as potent as the factors that caused the Civil War... hhmmm...   \",\n",

She's a kind old thing, and she's almost a local landmark for everyone in the immediate area, who all like to stop and say hello to her. Well, today I was taken aback when I saw a big 'Auction' sign across the front of her place! My first thought was, 'Oh shivers, she's died!' I didn't know what to think. As I was walking back, there were two people cleaning up a bit around the small front yard of the place, and I asked them, well, where was she? Was she OK? It turns out that she's simply gone to a nursing home. Fair enough - she looked a pretty frail little thing. I'm just glad nothing awful happened to her. It's funny how it's little things like that shock you in such a strange way.   \",\n",

Sebbie...   I was talking to Michelle this morning, and she told me a funny story from last night. They made and lit a really huge bonfire on the property last night, with lots of the boys' friends and cousins and stuff there too. Well, once the flames took hold and started leaping up into the sky, the mountain of fire was shooting up sparks really high up into the black night sky. Must've looked amazing. Then one of the kids said it looked like a volcano, with all the sparks rushing out. Well, Sebbie (who's 7) literally freaked out, and he bolted! He ran the 500+ meters all the way home, with poor Michelle running after him! The poor kid must have freaked out somehow - he must've thought it really  was  a volcano and bolted for the safety of home! He was fine by the time a puffed Michelle caught up with him, and he slept with his Nan last night (for fun), and he was fine today. But that's  very  Sebbie - you never know exactly what he's thinking sometimes! He's unique - beautiful!        Josh...   My eldest turns 11 on Friday - eleven?! I can hardly believe it! I'll catch up with him after school briefly on Friday, and then he's off to Cubs that night. He's gonna have a few of his friends over the next day, which he'll absolutely love. Whoo hoo! talking to my mum on the phone tonight, we were comparing notes at how fast he's growing up, and laffing at how small he was at what seemed like just a short while ago! Now he's gonna be a 6-footer-plus in just a few years, I reckon.          Manly...   We won! Manly beat Canberra today, in a great display of Rugby League! Now we'll be off the bottom of the ladder!

Good, because I have plenty of time to get some homework done before the weekend, and because I only have to carry one book around all day for the one class I have that meets on Friday. Bad, because between Chapel and my sole Friday class, I have over 4 hours of nothing, which can get 'dumb and bowing' (thank you, Homestar!).   I've got a little work to do over the weekend. Andy'll be practicing with his band, so I've got plenty of quiet time to get it done. I have my first test of the semester to study for (Christian Home, all fill in the blank, no multiple choice), and some experiments I have to get done for Vocal Performance. I have to dust and wash my bedding, go on vocal rest, and adjust the humidity and hydration in my house to see how it affects my voice. Then I have to write a paper about it. Oh, and I have to memorize three pages from  A Streetcar Named Desire  using my directing notes, so I can perform the scene with a random partner for Contemp. Drama.  The dog is driving us crazy.

I never shut this thing off unless I’m going to be out of the house for an eon of hours. It’s on twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, which is actually better for it than repeated offings and onings. At least that’s what I tell myself. Still, you can imagine what an event it is for me to actually hit the off switch. So, I curled up to sleep, and found I couldn’t. I heard every little noise; every creak of floorboards, every settling of windowsills, every crick, and crack. I resorted to turning the radio on very low, just so I could have something going. Even that wasn’t enough. Apparently, as annoying as it is to be addicted to, it’s a sort of lullaby to me, in a way. I’m so used to it, that I’m not certain how to sleep without it. The noises, I suppose, wouldn’t have been quite so deafening to my nerves, if I hadn’t experienced the joys of finding a squirrel in my house yesterday; so every time I hear a noise, now, I think it’s another one. I like squirrels just as much as anyone else, but my boys would try to catch it. I’m sure there’s nothing in here, I’m sure it’s just my imagination, but I still want to go back to the days when all I had to worry over was whether Mulder and Scully were going to kiss or not!

Men can, and often do, attend to listen, and also to share their work.  Personally, the readings are my therapy…I laugh, ponder on the intricacies of life and am enlightened each time I go. One of my favorite aspects about the readings is the fact that they are not just about poetry, but about the written and spoken word. Our features and open mic performers read whatever turns them on, be it a poem, a passage from her book, an essay, a song, an article-anything! Now, I could write a book about all the spectacular comings-and-goings at Robin’s but, I’d rather you come see for yourself. If you’re ever in the neighborhood-stop by!            \",\n",

I am writing to you para decirles que life is great hear in cali. Your grandchildren keep asking about you. They can't wait to see you. Being a nurse is kind of difficult for me. Whenever I see those children sick, my heart just breaks apart. Sometimes I think about it and I ask myself what if my children were as sick as these innocent little kids? I am not trying to think about this anymore. So wat I'm going to do is take some time off and go to mexico for the summer. I'll be waiting here for you with opened hands.

The boy decides to go home and try it out. As he is greeted by his mother at the front door he says, “I know the whole truth.” His mother quickly hands him $20 and says, “Just don't tell your father.”   Quite pleased, the boy waits for his father to get home from work, and greets him with, “I know the whole truth.” The father promptly hands him $40 and says, “Please don't say a word to your mother.”   Very pleased, the boy is on his way to school the next day, when he sees the mailman at his front door. The boy greets him by saying, “I know the whole truth.” The mailman drops the mail, opens his arms and says, “Then come give your FATHER a big hug.”                 \",\n",

I took the  boys  out for lunch, and Alex wanted to come home with me (sob!). It was great to be with them - as always. I had a nap this arvo, and had a very realistic dream of sailing with my dad (which we did for years when I was a young teenager etc). I awoke with tears streaming down my face! It's amazing, isn't it? After over 8 years, I still really miss him. A plus was that my final  George Johnston  book arrived, ' The Darkness Outside ' - that's the one I was waiting for! Whoo hoo! And finally... I also received ' The Fisher King ' on video - one of those quirky films that i absolutely love - can't describe it, just know that I love the whole feel of it. Did I spend the day/arvo/evening on the turps? Nope, didn't touch a drop - didn't feel like it! It's fucking horrible being alone on your birthday - even my flatmate left this morning to spend the w/end with her folks down the coast! So, home alone! lol. Oh well, life is... interesting!

And the secound said he would build his out of gingerbread. And with no more to say than that they parted.  The first wolf finished building his house. It was now a wonderful gingerbread house. He admired the outside for a while until he decided to go inside and admire the house. As he was admiring his house from the inside a knock at the door was heard. It was a pig and he wanted in. “let me in, let me in” said the pig. “Not by the hairs of my big chin chin.”  Replied the wolf. “Then I’ll eat and I’ll eat and ill eat your house down.” replied the pig. And within 2 seconds the house was devoured along with the wolf.    Then without hearing a thing, the second wolf finished building his chocolate house. He also admired his hose for a very long time before going inside, and just like the first wolf there was a knock at the door. And without a doubt it was the pig and he wanted in. “let me in, let me in “said the pig.   “Not by the hairs of my big chin chin.” Replied the second wolf. “Then I’ll eat and I’ll eat and I’ll eat your house down”. And just like before within 2 seconds the house was devoured, along with this wolf to.  About 1 hr later the fat pig was found dead on the ground obviously his appetite didn’t agree with him   The end          ',\n",

In addition to the data regions table, matrix, list, and chart, report items also include text box, image, line, rectangle, and subreport.    Text Box    Text boxes display all text data in a report. A table or matrix cell include a text boxes by default to display data. Text boxes can be placed anywhere on a report and can contain labels, fields, or calculated data. You use expressions to define data in text boxes.    Image    Images display binary image data in a report. An image report item can use a URL to display an image stored on a Web server, display embedded image data, or display an image from binary data in a database. Reporting Services supports .bmp, .jpeg, .gif, and .png files.     Line    Lines are graphical elements that you can place anywhere on a page. A line is defined with a start and end point and can have a number of styles (for example, weight and color) assigned to it. A line has no data associated with it.     Rectangle    Rectangles can be used in two ways: as a graphical element and as a container for other report items. When you place report items within a rectangle, you can move them with the rectangle. This is useful for keeping numerous text boxes and other items together in a report.    Subreport    A subreport is an item in a report that points to another report on the report server. The report that the subreport refers to can be a full report that can also run on its own, or it can be a report that looks best when embedded within the main report. When you define a subreport, you can also define parameters to filter data in the subreport.   When deciding whether to use a subreport, you may want to consider using a data region instead. Because the report server processes each instance of a subreport as a separate report, performance can be an issue. Data regions provide much of the same functionality and flexibility as subreports, but with better performance.    Item Properties    All items in a report, including groups, table and matrix columns and rows, the above items, and the report itself, have properties associated with it. These properties govern the appearance and behavior of the item. For information about the properties associated with an item, see the documentation for that item.   Regards',\n",

He returns to Devon school in New Hampshire, where he spent the better part of his boyhood. While visiting, nostalgia has its way with him as he reflects upon memories made within the walls of the school. Two specific places stand out in his mind, and he decides to go and visit them. The first place he visits is a marble staircase. As he stands at the base of the staircase, with the image of a moon scraped into the marble, his once worn memories begin to come back to him. He steps away from the marble and leaves, walking to his second spot. Despite bad weather, he finds his destination. A huge oak tree, standing distinct among many of the same. Once a place feared by Gene, this tree is now just a statue of his adolescence, pitied upon for its state. As he walks back to shelter, the reader shares a sense of peace with the man, finally coming to grips with his past. Gene flashes back to his childhood, standing at the base of the tree with his best friend Finny and 3 other boys. The tree is humongous. But there is not a doubt in Finny’s mind that the boys could climb it with ease. However, the other boys aren’t as sure. All of the boys are attending Devon school’s first summer session to prepare for World War II. The other boys doubt that the stunt is possible, so to prove them wrong, Finny jumps out of the tree and plunges into the water below. Gene follows. This act is a flawless example of the effect that Finny has upon Gene. After Gene’s jump, the other boys refuse, and they head inside. As they walk inside, Finny and the other boys begin to wrestle, although Gene is worried about whether they will be late for dinner. After the games, dinner, and goodnights, Finny and Gene return to their dorm to go to sleep.                                                  Chapter 2 Upon waking up and going to breakfast, Gene and Finny are confronted by Mr. Prud’homme about their absence at dinner the night before. When asked, Finny quickly provides a long, elaborate, and satisfying story. Gene tells him of how his antics were inspired by preparation.  After lying to Mr. Prud'homme, the two go back to their room where Finny puts on a pink shirt. He claims that, since there is no flag to show, he will wear this bright shirt to represent a bombing in Europe.  When Finny walks out into the public, he is confronted by a teacher about his shirt. He launches into another elaborate story about the significance of his shirt, and is allowed to wear it.  Gene is amazed at how Finny could get away with anything. Interrogations and near escapes flurry about the evening, and Gene begins to resent Finny. As they leave, Finny suggests that they go back to the river and tree. They swim for a bit, and Finny tells Gene to jump out again. As he is standing on the branch off of which he is to leap, he begins to fall over. Finny quickly stablizes him.  As a result, Gene’s resentment towards Finny grows.                                                             Chapter 3             The boys start a club surrounding the tree jumping, It is quite a success. Gene begins to worry and resent Finny even more as the days pass. He does whatever he’s told. Finny is a God to most of the students at the school. Being the King Midas clone that he is, he invents a game called Blitzball, and It becomes a popular sport among the students. Gene reflects upon this fact, as the game is still played to this day. One day, Finny decides that he is going to break a swimming record simply because he can. The record had been carved in stone, and after a seconds debate, Finny breaks the record. Gene insists upon making it official, but Finny refuses. Finny’s silence made him only more respected among the boys. The school’s way, getting them all ready for war, gets in the way of Gene's friendship with Finny and confuses him as he tries to understand this behavior. Finny suggests that they go to the beach, and despite the rules, Gene agrees. Upon arriving, they dive into the water immediately and Gene is overpowered by the strength of the waves, so he sits on the shore watching Finny play in the water. Then they have dinner at a hot dog stand along the Boardwalk, and everyone stares at Finny’s tan body. Then, they drink a few beers at a bar. Before sleep, Finny tells Gene that he is his best friend. Despite his wishes to reply earnestly, his wall of resentment has grown too high for that.                                                                         Chapter 4             Gene wakes up on the beach before Finny, and proceeds to watch his first sunrise. He is revived by the sunrise, but is eager to get back to school due to a trigonometry test in a few hours Finny finally wakes up and is carefree. They swim, and ride their bikes back home. Gene fails the test, yet continues to play with Finny and co.  Later, while studying, Gene decides that Finny is distracting him on purpose, and labels him as an enemy. To show him up, he studies harder and longer. Though, he still attends meetings to keep Finny from growing suspicious. As the two spend more time together, Gene’s suspicions grow larger and larger. Once, while studying, Finny tries to get Gene to come out to the tree to jump. Though he wants to study, he goes anyways. The pair mount the tree, and as Finny walks out to the edge, Gene shakes the branch that Finny is standing on. He falls out of the tree, hitting the ground full force. After this, Gene plunges into the water below. This shows that Finny was pleased with his actions, and felt as though he had avenged his independence.                                                                         Chapter 5             Finny is sent to the nurse, to recover. In Finny’s absence, Gene sits in the quiet of his room, pondering what he has done. He is partially happy, but mostly regretful. He tries on Finny’s clothes, and marvels at the grandiose feeling evoked when he tries on the pink shirt. Since Finny is injured, he decides to take his place, in order to fill the void that has built up inside of him as a result of Finny’s perfection. The news that Finny will not be able to play sports ever again leaks out to the public. Gene is asked to visit Finny. He goes, and tries to confess to the crime, but Finny refuses to believe that his best friend would do such a thing. Summer session ends, and both boys return home for a break.  Gene is invited to Finny’s home, and stays there for a brief time period. Finny is taken out of school for a few months until his leg can heal properly.                                                                         Chapter 6             Upon returning to the school, Gene discovers that the mood of the school is completely different. Everyone’s carefree, whimsical mood had diminished to the hand of a hardened mood, represented by the season of winter. Young teachers had been sent off to fight in the war, and new students are arriving at the school. A boy rooming across from Gene’s name is Brinker Hadley. When Gene walks to the Crew House for a meeting, Quackenbush scorns him for being late. He calls Gene “maimed,” and Gene attacks him. Both students are scorned. While walking back with the headmaster, Gene is reprimanded for his behavior over the summer. All of the behavior that Finny conned him into. Since summer sports are beginning, Finny decides that since he cant play sports, Gene will have to participate in his place.                                                                         Chapter 7             After his fight, Gene goes to rinse himself off in the river’s water. While there, he decides that the once refreshing water is now disgusting and whispering the memories of Finny’s fall into his ear.  He finishes up, and goes back inside. Brinker Hadley comes into his room shortly after and accuses him of purposely tripping Finny. Gene refuses to validate this accusation and quickly denies it. To change the subject, he suggests that they go have a cigarette. Brinker agrees, and they go down to the dungeon, where Gene is again bombarded by accusations. He denies this set also, and realizes that he doesn’t even have a cigarette. He goes back upstairs. During the summer, the boys were too wrapped up in ignorant bliss to actually comprehend the reality of the war. The mood of the winter worsens, and the boys begin to realize the severity of the war at hand. The students work more, and play less (with the exception of Leper). Some of the boys resent him for his carefree attitude, while others envy it. One day, when walking back from snow shoveling, the boys see Finny in a chair, and despite their excitement, Gene is disappointed. All of his independence is sure to pass.                                                                         Chapter 8             Finny being back is a shock to Gene. Everything that he had discovered in his absence seemed to dissipate with one sight of Finny. As some time passes, Gene realizes that he finds comfort in the sight of Finny’s cast. It makes him feel superior to him. After all, Finny is dependent upon Gene for transportation around the school. Finny discovers that Gene is planning to enlist in the army, and is slightly bothered by this. Finny, still stuck in summer time mode, suggests that the two skip class. Gene agrees, and they go to the gym. Upon arrival, Finny asks Gene what sports he has signed up for. Gene tells him that he hasn’t signed up for any because they wont be able to take trips as a result of the war. Finny says that the war is just a conspiracy against fun, and Gene responds defensively.  The boys decide that Gene will participate in the Olympics with the assistance of Finny’s coaching. They begin practicing by running laps around the headmaster’s house.                                                                         Chapter 9             Gene loses the reality of the war to Finny’s optimism. He begins to believe only what he wants to believe. His once realized mind becomes a filter, veiling him to reality. Gene begins to change. Instead of being the obedient, tractable boy he’d always been, he began to think for himself and his independence has grown tall. People in the school are swayed by pamphlets, movies, and announcements, dripping with propaganda, to enlist in the army. Despite the danger and sadness that consumes the boys due to their lost friends, they still manage to joke about them. Their spirits are relatively high in a time of depression. The adventures of Finny and Gene are no longer existent, due to the condition of Finny’s leg. To raise their spirits, the school held a carnival. Instead of embracing the carnival, the boys rip it to shreds. Gene wins all of the athletic events, Finny burns a book, and the others destroy parts of the carnival.                                                                         Chapter 10             Gene goes to visit Leper in Vermont. When he steps out into the air, something about the weather is comforting. The contrast between the weather at school and the weather in the outside is symbolic. When he sees Leper, all is well at first. Then, Leper begins telling him about a twitch in his lip. Then, he begins yelling and screaming about the army and life in general. When Gene reacts oddly, Leper starts yelling at him for isolating him from the herds of “normal” people in society. The attacks become blatantly mean, and Gene attacks Leper. The fight is interrupted by the presence of Mrs. Lepellier. As Gene prepares to leave, Leper invites him for lunch, and Gene stays. After lunch, The two boys take a walk outside. Emotions fly and Gene leaves Leper out in the cold, and runs into town filled with anger.                                                                         Chapter 11             Upon arrival at the school, Gene decides that he is going to be more attentive to Finny. He is Genuinely concerned about his friend, and feels guilty for his actions, proving that he has grown as a person. He is no longer scared of people, sports, or Finny. He has matured and grown into a man. When he is asked of Leper’s condition, he replies maturely instead of just telling them all that Leper has gone crazy. During pro army speeches, Brinker confronts Gene about why he will not enlist. Brinker thinks it’s because of Finny’s arrival, and grows very jealous of Finny. During a tutoring session, Finny seems unhappy. With much conversation and acceptance, Finny finally accepts that there is a war going on. Brinker decides that he is going to investigate the fall of Finny, declaring him a casualty. Finny is oblivious, while others refuse to be. Leper finally gives Brinker the facts that he needs, and Gene is found out. Finny, once realizing that Gene had betrayed him, Finny breaks down and begins to cry, telling everyone that he doesn’t care about the accident. He runs out of the room, and as the boys recover, they hear the sound of his body falling down the marble staircase.                                                                         Chapter 12             Gene’s leg is broken again. He is sent to the hospital, again. Gene’s growth flourishes in Finny’s absence, and the other boys begin to resent Gene for ruining Finny’s life. Gene goes to visit Finny. Finny verbally assaults Gene and Gene decides to leave the room, only to return again later. Gene comes back to drop off clothes for Finny, and Finny is civil towards him. The two talk deeply of the war, and the injury. This conversation is a flawless example of Gene’s growth. Gene leaves, and revels in his new found confidence. Finny is scheduled to have an operation on his leg. When Gene talks to the doctor about the operation, he is informed that Finny has died due to a bone marrow leak. Gene is shocked beyond comprehension. He does not cry at the deathbed, nor the funeral.                                                                         Chapter 13             Life moves on at a rapid pace back at the school. The war has come, and the school will be used as a parachute field. Gene is encouraged to join forces and fight in the war. Brinker and Gene both enlist in the navy and plan to stay training in the United States for as long as possible. Emotions within Gene are very calm and reflective considering the circumstances. He remembers everything that he had done at the school, and laughs about his past and the times spent with Finny. As he walks out of the school, he decides that war is ridiculous, and peace is underrated. He has surpassed his selfishness, and grown into  a man.     \",\n",

When the door of happiness closes, another opens; but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.    Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile, because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.    Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.    May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, and enough hope to make you happy! .    The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.    The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.    When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. Live your life so at the end, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.    Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away!    The road to success is not straight. There is a curve called Failure, a loop called Confusion, speed bumps called Friends, red lights called Enemies, caution lights called Family. You will have flats called Jobs. But, if you have a spare called Determination, an engine called Perseverance, insurance called Faith, you will make it to a place called Success.           \",\n",

On Febuary 27th 2003, my life was to change in a way I could never imagine. My mother, My best friend of such a young age of 45 was diagnosed with stage 4 Lung cancer with 13 tumors that spread to her brain.    At first they gave us hope, with treatment 18-24 months to live, without 6 weeks. So... you tell me, which would you choose? You see all these wonderful success stories all over the television, newspapers,internet etc. We all figured what can it hurt if it can increase her life span. Yeah, what a joke!   The first month or two was, well, o.k.. Mom was still pretty active, she'd play with the grandchildren, thank god they came early in her life, or she would have never known the wonderful children they have become. After that the chemotherapy took over my mother. She could not eat without getting sick two minutes later, very weak and tired, and she sat in a recliner almost all day everyday, until the end, what a way to live. Strength and courage, I don't know how she did it, fighting every minute of her life that she did not even now how much of it was left.   She called me in the beginning to make sure I, as the oldest, knew what items were to go to who. She feared that if she did not tell me then she would not remember later. My grandmother was to get a picture with a special saying on the back, just hours after she passes. I said 'Mom, why me, I can not deal with you saying this to me, I am not ready for this.' How selfish was I? My mother is dying and I am only 25 with a full life ahead of me and all I can say is 'I can not deal with it.' My mother knew how much I was hurting, I was not only losing my mother , but my best friend. She also knew no matter how much I was hurting I would still do everything she asked.   My mother, I feel was robbed of her life not just by the cancer but the treatment that was to help the cancer. It was her decision no one else's to take the chemo. We stuck by whatever decision she chose. She may have only lived two months verse seven months  without the treatment but, I feel it would have been worth it to live those two months to the fullest extent, enjoying the last of her life. Instead she lived the last five months in misery. She did not know, she just wanted to get better and she sure fought for it.   The time had come. At 6:00 a.m. on September 6, 2003, I got the call, 'Hurry, the nurse is here and she says it is getting close', out the door I went. My whole family, grandparents, 2 aunts, 3 uncles, 1 step sister, stepfather, myself and my mother's best friend. We all stayed by her bedside in my grandparents home for 2 days. I held my mother's hand and told her what a wonderful mother she was, how much I love her and it was o.k. to let go, she had fought long enough. She still fought for about 24 hours longer, at exactly 4:22 p.m. on September 7,2003 she finally let go her long battle and god took her into his arms. My mother, my best friend, my hero, what a meritorious person she was and all the wonderful memories I will pass on to my children and their children to cherish forever and eternity.   People always say ' Oh, honey, I know it is hard, but it will get easier.' What is their definition of easier? The longer time goes on the more I miss her and the harder it gets. So, really, does it get easier or do some people just forget?               \",\n",

The previous night, a special ops meeting had taken place in an American outpost just outside of Warbah, Kuwait.  Attending, had been Joshua Bradley, a member of the American delta force.  Bradley had been called to rescue another member of the Special Forces that had been captured earlier in the week. Not only to rescue him, but to also reacquire his explosives and destroy the bridge that should have already been in rubble.  The POW, Jim Foley, along with another of his comrades, was sent to destroy a bridge, on the Iraqi, Kuwait border; 50 miles south of Umm Qasar.  However, guards spotted them and Foley was captured.  Thus Bradley’s call.  Taken to the outpost, he was briefed on the situation and put on the helicopter to the Kuwait Iraqi border.    Sitting in the helicopter now, Bradley sweated.  Just thinking of the job he had to do overwhelmed him.  According to the intelligence compound, he was going to have to pass through the guards and checkpoints unnoticed.  If the alarm was raised, then things would become difficult.  In the cockpit, the pilot glanced back at him and noticed that he was studying his map.  Indeed he was, he wasn’t given a GPS this round.  They would take to long to connect to the satellite and, at worst, might be pin pointed giving away his position.  A bump jolted him from his studying.  He looked up and saw the drop point.  His rifle, a colt m-167A with an attached grenade launcher, sat ready in his hands. It was just before dawn, the sun was already beginning to rise, and the dew had already soaked into the ground.  “Ok! This is it!”  That was his cue.  The helicopter was 15 feet above the ground; it was time to go.   Bradley slid to the ground on rope.  He watched as the helicopter sailed away.  In his mind he could still hear his commanding officer, “Ok, just get in, get Foley, get the C4, blow the bridge, get out.  BUT! Remember! If the alarm is raised, you’re probably toast.  Stealth is everything.”    It was quiet now, the helicopter was already on its way back to base, and he was alone.  He crunched his way through the underbrush and scoped the area.  He was in a canyon.  There were two sheer, smooth rock walls on either side.  A way down the path, there was a steady decline in the terrain. The path wiggled side to side in the same fashion of switchbacks.  A small building was at the landing.  Across from the building was a ditch the spread the length between either side of the canyon walls.  A bridge, large and strong, strong enough for a tank Bradley noted, was on the far left side of the ditch.  Carefully, he inched his way to the first low drop on by the top of the switchback.  On the landing were three trucks one crossing the bridge and the other two waiting in line.  Suddenly, the roaring sounds of a jet sounded. Frantically he looks around, fearing that it would give away his position.  Interestingly enough, it was an allied A-10 Warthog.  Squinting, he could make out something falling from the plane’s bomb bay.  The ordinance howled as they pounded the tow trucks on the landing. The third made it over the bridge.  On impact, a man ran out of the building.  He was armed.  Seeing this, Bradley scrunched down even lower.  As he steadied his rifle the sights were leveled.  The rifled sounded off as three shots burst through the crisp air.  As another soldier saw his fellow on the ground, he looked up and spotted the sweating Specialist.  As the enemy opened fire so did Bradley.  Having a better weapon and training far exceeding his opponent’s, the combatant fell quickly.  Upon seeing his opponent on the ground, acting rather un-life like, he stood up and made his way down the path.  However, another soldier came across the bridge.  Seeing Bradley, he took cover behind a sign near the bridge.  A sign doesn’t hold up very well against a grenade.  Neither does the man behind the sign.  Continuing down the path, he trotted towards the building on the landing.    Entering, he found a radio, medical supplies, and a refrigerator that had food in it, but was unplugged.  Not really finding another use for any item except the medical supplies, which he had already commandeered, he left.  After crossing the bridge, the path took two different routes.  One of which turned right and led up to a checkpoint. The other route went through another canyon and split into many different paths.  Having been warned to avoid detection, he decided upon the left route.  Walking cautiously down the path, he observed that the sun was fully raised.  Avoiding detection would be more difficult now than ever.  Ah, man! One wrong step and I’ll land myself in the pit with the rest of the MIAs.  Bradley tensed with every sound, watching cautiously around every corner.  He was in a small canyon, with rock on either side, smoothed by the blowing sand, and nothing but sand and dirt in between.

I went and showered and got all dolled up, just so I could go to Klein Bank and get the wrong fucking thing. Then I had to go to the grocery store...and before I left my dad yelled at me, and I felt so frustrated I cried. So I cried and went to Brians. He cheered me up, as Always! *Thanks Baby!* We went to his house, so he could call Alex about practice. Well, he said that he was going to get something to eat with his girlfriend so he'd call back, this was at 5:15. 7:15 he called back! Finally he was ready to meet up. Then when we met and he could follow us back, he wanted to stop at Mc.Donalds...yeah, I thought he had just eaten too? Weird...I think so. So we did, and then they got down to buisness and started playing some kickass shit! They are getting really good together, and they've only had 3 practices (Total Hours=6) I just am so proud!! I can't believe how amazing he is! I know that they could really get somewhere when they get their band together! Tomorrow we are going to go look for people to capture! They are excited to get shit rolling! I am too...even though I don't do much. I just tell them what sounds good...fill the water glass...print stuff...drive...I mean I just do little odds and ends just to make things easier for my Baby!!                      *Hopes Brian and I get those jobs at Wal-mart* (Keep fingers Crossed!)                  \",\n",

Are u feeling  blue ?Or maybe you're seeing  red ?Or are you just  green  with envy?Understand colours and take control of your life.Teenage August 2004 issue(5566& K-one),Health Bits paints you a clearer picture.         We are always surrounded by colours.From the clothes we wear to the walls we paint.But what most of us don't know is how easily we are affected by these colours.Our emotions and physical state are strongly influenced by the colours that surround us.   It's already been scientifically proven that our physicological functions are related to specific colours.Why do you think hospitals are painted in calming earth tones,or fast food restuarants are bathed in red and oranges hues?   They each have different effects on the human body...      How does colour therapy work?   So,how exactly can colour help in our everyday lives?   Here's a list of the common colours we encounter and how we can apply it to our own well-being   - Red    - Orange    - Yellow    - Green    - Violet    - Black    - White    - Blue              Red     ------     When we think of red,the words that come to mind are love,passion and even anger.Physically,red is energising and revitalising,helping to stimulate the brainwaves,heart rates and blood pressure..It is also the colour of love.          If you're feeling tired and lethargic,red is the perfect colour to concentrate on.However,too much of this colour may make you irritable and impatient.               \",\n",

It's been a week plus since i have last blogged and indeed there is something that have happenned that hindered me from blogging. I have from my last entry ..been very dry spiritually and from there that is  where the time of backsliding begins. To many people, backsliding seems like a process that you simply go away from God. But to me...that is also true but most of the time , it is a choice . So from my dry relationship with God , slowly i started to withdraw from people , from God , started to give up my dreams, my passion . It is very easy to do it and later the standards and whatever principles that have been shaping my life, I also have easily let it go and even welcome some of them . Particularly temptations.  I thank God for His continous faithfulness and saw chances / opportunities to work in  instead of seeing me a rebellious and good for nothing sheep that does not requires His Grace which He have died for. I really want to appreciate God for His Holy SPirit continues to prompt me that He have come for the sick and not the healthy . His Grace is forever sufficient for every need and hurt. God's presence continues to linger even when I have sinned and it is like a perfume that will never go away.  Like i Said, I recently had an accident which involves my front section of the car literally smashed by another car . After that my dentures broke and furthermore , my handphone refuses to call or receive call from anyone. and in all this  I have to put off my savings for the guitar and I have to spend all these money to procure. I always encourage people that nothing that happened is a coincidence and God is always in control.  Well guess what , i figured that God is using 'His Burning Bush' in modern context to gain my attention to what is important...not the challenges that He have allowed but more importantly my time and relationship with God. So one day i decided to wake myself up from this condemn life that i was leading .  And I decided to turn back towards God one fine day and am willing to face God and my consequences of my actions simply because God's presence in my life is worth fighting for and worth it all to go thru. Though sooner or later , I knew that I have to face my consequences and what the heck ../? But I hold unto to the belief,...yes i will face my consequences , but I also believe God will help me to overcome it all and the overall results a refreshing touch and a new relationship with total dependance will be established.  After even writing this blog , I stood up close my bedroom door, slowly starting to pray in the spirit ...started to pray in strong tongues...and then i started to kneel and really just cried out to God ....and the rest is an experience that words can seems to express..SO i challenged you guys going thru the same things that i went thru just a few days ago , have u decided yet...ultimately it is ur choice that will determine and not allow circumstances to change you.

The obvious flaw is that emotions are not so easily destroyed, because a word alone does not convey          emotion, it is a whole set of neurological impulses which culiminate in an emotion.           still it is an interesting theory.          &lt;b&gt;Further discussion about words and images&lt;/b&gt;          I have noticed over the years, that words can talk back to you, yes it is true, Take the word laugh, there is something          in the way the letters are arranged that brings to mind a mouth opened wide in laughter, similarly with the word serious,          the letters seem to remind me of a person with a serious face, similarly, the two oo's in gloomy merge with the letter m          to create an atmosphere of gloom. I realised that this observation is not unique, i met at least two people who seem          to feel the same. I have since, realised that this phenomenon is not singular to the english language, at least two other          languages seem to exhibit this. however, scripted languages dont seem to.          I m left wondering, is it the association of emotions with the words that causes this or is there something uncanny......&lt;/font&gt;           \",\n",

       " \"                                                         Behind The Scenes Of The Iraq War   The plan for the Iraq war, which has erupted in the face of opposition from the entire world, was drawn up at least decades ago, by Israeli strategists   In its attempt to realize its strategy of destabilizing or dividing the Middle Eastern Arab states, Israel has Egypt, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia on its list of subsequent targets.   As these lines are being written, the United States of America has begun striking at Iraq. Despite the fact that most countries of the world, and even the majority of the USA's allies, opposed it, the US administration was determined for the strike to go ahead. When we look behind the scenes of this insistence, it seems that Israel and its powerful lobby in the US, have the greatest share in the make-up.   In fact, Israel's policy aimed at the fragmentation of Iraq has lengthy historical roots-   The Age-Old Israeli Plan to Divide Iraq   An ambitious report entitled 'A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s,' which appeared in the World Zionist Organization's periodical Kivunim in February 1982 disclosed a strategy aimed at making the whole of the Middle East a kind of 'living space' for Israel. The report, drawn up by Oded Yinon, an Israeli journalist and formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry of Israel, set out the scenario of the 'division of Iraq' in these terms:   Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel's targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria- Iraq is, once again, no different in essence from its neighbors, although its majority is Shi'ite and the ruling minority Sunni. Sixty-five percent of the population has no say in politics, in which an elite of 20 percent holds the power. In addition there is a large Kurdish minority in the north, and if it weren't for the strength of the ruling regime, the army and the oil revenues, Iraq's future state would be no different than that of Lebanon in the past- In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi'ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. 1)   This was not the only announcement of the Israeli plan to atomize Middle East, including Iraq. As Israel Shahak, the notable Israeli scholar known for his dedication to a peaceful solution in the Middle East, explained that Yinon was just echoing the views of Israeli hawks:   The idea that all the Arab states should be broken down, by Israel, into small units, occurs again and again in Israeli strategic thinking. For example, Ze'ev Schiff, the military correspondent of Ha'aretz (and probably the most knowledgeable in Israel, on this topic) writes about the 'best' that can happen for Israeli interests in Iraq: 'The dissolution of Iraq into a Shi'ite state, a Sunni state and the separation of the Kurdish part' (Ha'aretz 6/2/1982). Actually, this aspect of the plan is very old. 2)   Thus, the plan was a serious one and this has been confirmed by the age-old Israeli support to non-Arab or non-Muslim minorities in the Muslim Arab states. The rebellious Kurds of northern Iraq was one of these strategic allies of Israel. During their revolt against the Baghdad regime, 1961-75, they have been financially and militarily supported by Israel. Israelis would love to see them carve up the northern part of Iraq, no matter how bloody and devastating such a civil war would be. However, the revolt failed in 1975, after loosing the support of its major patron, the Shah.   Fifteen years later, a new opportunity arose for Israel, an opportunity from the ambitions of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.   Israel's Role in the Gulf War   Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, after his bloody war against Iran in the 80's, invaded Kuwait in a sudden attack on August 1, 1990, giving rise to an international crisis. Israel headed the list of those forces that encouraged that crisis. Israel was the fiercest supporter of the attitude adopted by the United States in the wake of the invasion of Kuwait. The Israelis even regarded the United States as moderate, and wanted a harsher policy. To such an extent in fact that the President of Israel Chaim Herzog recommended that the American use nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the Israeli lobby in the United States was working to bring about a wide-ranging attack on Iraq.   This whole situation encouraged the idea in the United States that the attack against Iraq under consideration was actually planned in Israel's interests. Pat Buchanan summarized this idea in the words 'There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States.'   Israelis had also initiated a serious propaganda campaign on the issue. Since this campaign was largely waged in secret, Mossad also entered the equation. Rogue Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky provides important information on this subject. According to Ostrovsky, Israel had wanted to wage war with the United States against Saddam long before the Gulf crisis. So much so in fact, that Israel began to implement the plan immediately after the Iran-Iraq war. Ostrovsky reports that Mossad's Psychological Warfare department (LAP - LohAma Psychologist) set about an effective pro-war campaign using misinformation techniques. 3)   A Mossad Agent Describes the Gulf War   Ostrovsky describes how Mossad used agents or sympathizers in various parts of the world in this campaign. Among the tools employed in the campaign were the horrible massacres done by missiles launched against civilian targets in Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. As Ostrovsky makes clear, Mossad's later use of these missiles as a propaganda tool was quite peculiar, since those missiles had actually been directed towards their targets by Mossad, with the help of information from US satellites. Having supported Saddam throughout his war with Iran, Israel was now disclosing his crimes. Ostrovsky writes:   The Mossad leaders know that if they could make Saddam appear bad enough and a threat to the Gulf oil supply, of which he'd been the protector up to that point, then the United States and its allies would not let him get away with anything, but would take measures that would all but eliminate his army and his weapons potential, especially if they were led to believe that this might just be their last chance before he went nuclear. 4)   The Israelis were so determined on this matter, and with regard to the United States, that on August 4, 1990, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy issued a diplomatically worded threat to William Brown, the American ambassador to Israel, stating that Israel 'expects the U.S. will fulfill all of the goals it set for itself at the beginning of the gulf crisis,' in other words that it attack Iraq. According to Levy, if the United States failed to do so, Israel would act unilaterally. 5)   It would be of enormous benefit to Israel to have the United States engage in the war and for Israel to remain entirely uninvolved: and that is indeed what happened.   Israel Forces the USA to War   However, the Israelis were actively involved in the United States' war plans. Some US staff officers involved in planning Operation Desert Storm received fine tactical advice from the Israelis that 'the best way of wounding Saddam was to strike at his family.'   The Mossad-inspired propaganda campaign reported by Ostrovsky set up the necessary public backing for the Gulf War. It was again Mossad local assistants who lit the touchpaper for the war. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm, run by Tom Lantos of the Israeli lobby, prepared a dramatic scenario to convince members of Congress on the subject of war against Saddam. Turan Yavuz, a noted Turkish journalist, describes the incident:   October 9, 1990. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm organizes a sitting in Congress on the subject of 'Iraq's Barbarities.' A number of 'eye witnesses' brought to the session by the lobbying firm maintain that Iraqi troops killed new-born babies in the hospital wards. One 'eye witness' describes the savagery in enormous detail, saying that Iraqi soldiers killed 300 new-born babies in one hospital alone. This information deeply disturbs the members of Congress. This works to President Bush's advantage. However, it later emerges that the eye witness brought by Hill and Knowlton to Congress is in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington. Nevertheless, the daughter's account is sufficient for members of Congress to give Saddam the nickname 'Hitler'. 6)   This leads to just one conclusion: that Israel played an important role in the United States' to wage its first war on Iraq. The second one is not much different.   The Pretext of 'War Against Terrorism'   Contrary to popular belief, the plan to attack Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime by force was prepared and placed on Washington's agenda long before the genesis of the 'war against terrorism,' which emerged in the wake of September 11. The first indication of this plan emerged in 1997. A group of pro-Israeli hawkish strategists in Washington D.C. began to put forward the scenario of the invasion of Iraq by manipulating the 'neo-con' think-tank, called PNAC (Project for The New American Century). The most notable names in the PNAC were those of Donald Rumsfeld and ###### Cheney, who as defense secretary and vice-president would be the most influential figures in the George W. Bush administration.   An article titled 'Invading Iraq Not a New Idea for Bush Clique: 4 Years Before 9/11 Plan Was Set' written by William Brunch and published in the Philadelphia Daily News, sets out the following facts:   But in reality, Rumsfeld, Vice President ###### Cheney, and a small band of conservative ideologues had begun making the case for an American invasion of Iraq as early as 1997 - nearly four years before the Sept. 11 attacks and three years before President Bush took office.   An obscure, ominous-sounding right-wing policy group called Project for the New American Century, or PNAC - affiliated with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rumsfeld's top deputy Paul Wolfowitz and Bush's brother Jeb - even urged then-President Clinton to invade Iraq back in January 1998. 7)   Is Oil the Real Objective?   Why were the PNAC members so determined to attack Iraq? The same article continues:  While oil is a backdrop to PNAC's policy pronouncements on Iraq, it doesn't seem to be the driving force. [Ian] Lustick, [a University of Pennsylvania political science professor and Middle East expert,] while a critic of the Bush policy, says oil is viewed by the war's proponents primarily as a way to pay for the costly military operation.

Lustick believes that a more powerful hidden motivator may be Israel.

       " \"                                                         Behind The Scenes Of The Iraq War   The plan for the Iraq war, which has erupted in the face of opposition from the entire world, was drawn up at least decades ago, by Israeli strategists   In its attempt to realize its strategy of destabilizing or dividing the Middle Eastern Arab states, Israel has Egypt, Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia on its list of subsequent targets.   As these lines are being written, the United States of America has begun striking at Iraq. Despite the fact that most countries of the world, and even the majority of the USA's allies, opposed it, the US administration was determined for the strike to go ahead. When we look behind the scenes of this insistence, it seems that Israel and its powerful lobby in the US, have the greatest share in the make-up.   In fact, Israel's policy aimed at the fragmentation of Iraq has lengthy historical roots-   The Age-Old Israeli Plan to Divide Iraq   An ambitious report entitled 'A Strategy for Israel in the 1980s,' which appeared in the World Zionist Organization's periodical Kivunim in February 1982 disclosed a strategy aimed at making the whole of the Middle East a kind of 'living space' for Israel. The report, drawn up by Oded Yinon, an Israeli journalist and formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry of Israel, set out the scenario of the 'division of Iraq' in these terms:   Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel's targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria- Iraq is, once again, no different in essence from its neighbors, although its majority is Shi'ite and the ruling minority Sunni. Sixty-five percent of the population has no say in politics, in which an elite of 20 percent holds the power. In addition there is a large Kurdish minority in the north, and if it weren't for the strength of the ruling regime, the army and the oil revenues, Iraq's future state would be no different than that of Lebanon in the past- In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi'ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. 1)   This was not the only announcement of the Israeli plan to atomize Middle East, including Iraq. As Israel Shahak, the notable Israeli scholar known for his dedication to a peaceful solution in the Middle East, explained that Yinon was just echoing the views of Israeli hawks:   The idea that all the Arab states should be broken down, by Israel, into small units, occurs again and again in Israeli strategic thinking. For example, Ze'ev Schiff, the military correspondent of Ha'aretz (and probably the most knowledgeable in Israel, on this topic) writes about the 'best' that can happen for Israeli interests in Iraq: 'The dissolution of Iraq into a Shi'ite state, a Sunni state and the separation of the Kurdish part' (Ha'aretz 6/2/1982). Actually, this aspect of the plan is very old. 2)   Thus, the plan was a serious one and this has been confirmed by the age-old Israeli support to non-Arab or non-Muslim minorities in the Muslim Arab states. The rebellious Kurds of northern Iraq was one of these strategic allies of Israel. During their revolt against the Baghdad regime, 1961-75, they have been financially and militarily supported by Israel. Israelis would love to see them carve up the northern part of Iraq, no matter how bloody and devastating such a civil war would be. However, the revolt failed in 1975, after loosing the support of its major patron, the Shah.   Fifteen years later, a new opportunity arose for Israel, an opportunity from the ambitions of the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein.   Israel's Role in the Gulf War   Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, after his bloody war against Iran in the 80's, invaded Kuwait in a sudden attack on August 1, 1990, giving rise to an international crisis. Israel headed the list of those forces that encouraged that crisis. Israel was the fiercest supporter of the attitude adopted by the United States in the wake of the invasion of Kuwait. The Israelis even regarded the United States as moderate, and wanted a harsher policy. To such an extent in fact that the President of Israel Chaim Herzog recommended that the American use nuclear weapons. On the other hand, the Israeli lobby in the United States was working to bring about a wide-ranging attack on Iraq.   This whole situation encouraged the idea in the United States that the attack against Iraq under consideration was actually planned in Israel's interests. Pat Buchanan summarized this idea in the words 'There are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East - the Israeli Defense Ministry and its amen corner in the United States.'   Israelis had also initiated a serious propaganda campaign on the issue. Since this campaign was largely waged in secret, Mossad also entered the equation. Rogue Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky provides important information on this subject. According to Ostrovsky, Israel had wanted to wage war with the United States against Saddam long before the Gulf crisis. So much so in fact, that Israel began to implement the plan immediately after the Iran-Iraq war. Ostrovsky reports that Mossad's Psychological Warfare department (LAP - LohAma Psychologist) set about an effective pro-war campaign using misinformation techniques. 3)   A Mossad Agent Describes the Gulf War   Ostrovsky describes how Mossad used agents or sympathizers in various parts of the world in this campaign. Among the tools employed in the campaign were the horrible massacres done by missiles launched against civilian targets in Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. As Ostrovsky makes clear, Mossad's later use of these missiles as a propaganda tool was quite peculiar, since those missiles had actually been directed towards their targets by Mossad, with the help of information from US satellites. Having supported Saddam throughout his war with Iran, Israel was now disclosing his crimes. Ostrovsky writes:   The Mossad leaders know that if they could make Saddam appear bad enough and a threat to the Gulf oil supply, of which he'd been the protector up to that point, then the United States and its allies would not let him get away with anything, but would take measures that would all but eliminate his army and his weapons potential, especially if they were led to believe that this might just be their last chance before he went nuclear. 4)   The Israelis were so determined on this matter, and with regard to the United States, that on August 4, 1990, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy issued a diplomatically worded threat to William Brown, the American ambassador to Israel, stating that Israel 'expects the U.S. will fulfill all of the goals it set for itself at the beginning of the gulf crisis,' in other words that it attack Iraq. According to Levy, if the United States failed to do so, Israel would act unilaterally. 5)   It would be of enormous benefit to Israel to have the United States engage in the war and for Israel to remain entirely uninvolved: and that is indeed what happened.   Israel Forces the USA to War   However, the Israelis were actively involved in the United States' war plans. Some US staff officers involved in planning Operation Desert Storm received fine tactical advice from the Israelis that 'the best way of wounding Saddam was to strike at his family.'   The Mossad-inspired propaganda campaign reported by Ostrovsky set up the necessary public backing for the Gulf War. It was again Mossad local assistants who lit the touchpaper for the war. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm, run by Tom Lantos of the Israeli lobby, prepared a dramatic scenario to convince members of Congress on the subject of war against Saddam. Turan Yavuz, a noted Turkish journalist, describes the incident:   October 9, 1990. The Hill and Knowlton lobbying firm organizes a sitting in Congress on the subject of 'Iraq's Barbarities.' A number of 'eye witnesses' brought to the session by the lobbying firm maintain that Iraqi troops killed new-born babies in the hospital wards. One 'eye witness' describes the savagery in enormous detail, saying that Iraqi soldiers killed 300 new-born babies in one hospital alone. This information deeply disturbs the members of Congress. This works to President Bush's advantage. However, it later emerges that the eye witness brought by Hill and Knowlton to Congress is in fact the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to Washington. Nevertheless, the daughter's account is sufficient for members of Congress to give Saddam the nickname 'Hitler'. 6)   This leads to just one conclusion: that Israel played an important role in the United States' to wage its first war on Iraq. The second one is not much different.   The Pretext of 'War Against Terrorism'   Contrary to popular belief, the plan to attack Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime by force was prepared and placed on Washington's agenda long before the genesis of the 'war against terrorism,' which emerged in the wake of September 11. The first indication of this plan emerged in 1997. A group of pro-Israeli hawkish strategists in Washington D.C. began to put forward the scenario of the invasion of Iraq by manipulating the 'neo-con' think-tank, called PNAC (Project for The New American Century). The most notable names in the PNAC were those of Donald Rumsfeld and ###### Cheney, who as defense secretary and vice-president would be the most influential figures in the George W. Bush administration.   An article titled 'Invading Iraq Not a New Idea for Bush Clique: 4 Years Before 9/11 Plan Was Set' written by William Brunch and published in the Philadelphia Daily News, sets out the following facts:   But in reality, Rumsfeld, Vice President ###### Cheney, and a small band of conservative ideologues had begun making the case for an American invasion of Iraq as early as 1997 - nearly four years before the Sept. 11 attacks and three years before President Bush took office.   An obscure, ominous-sounding right-wing policy group called Project for the New American Century, or PNAC - affiliated with Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rumsfeld's top deputy Paul Wolfowitz and Bush's brother Jeb - even urged then-President Clinton to invade Iraq back in January 1998. 7)   Is Oil the Real Objective?   Why were the PNAC members so determined to attack Iraq? The same article continues:  While oil is a backdrop to PNAC's policy pronouncements on Iraq, it doesn't seem to be the driving force. [Ian] Lustick, [a University of Pennsylvania political science professor and Middle East expert,] while a critic of the Bush policy, says oil is viewed by the war's proponents primarily as a way to pay for the costly military operation.   'I'm from Texas, and every oil man that I know is against military action in Iraq,' said PNAC's Schmitt. 'The oil market doesn't need disruption.'   Lustick believes that a more powerful hidden motivator may be Israel. He said Bush administration hawks believe that a show of force in Iraq would somehow convince Palestinians to accept a peace plan on terms favorable to Israel- 8)   This, therefore, is the principal motivation behind the plan to attack Iraq: to serve Israel's Middle East strategy.   This fact has also been identified by other Middle East experts. Cengiz ?andar, a Turkish Middle East expert, for instance, describes the real power behind the plan to attack Iraq thus:   ... Who is directing the attack on Iraq? Vice-President ###### Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice. These are the 'senior level' backers of the attack. Yet the rest of the iceberg is even richer and more interesting. There are a number of 'lobbies.'  Heading these lobbies are the Jewish Institute for Security Affairs team, pro-Likud and Israeli-right and known for their close relations with US arms manufacturers. These have close relations with the 'arms lobby,' Lockheed, Northrop, General Dynamics and Israeli military industries ... JINSA's fundamental principle is this: America's and Israel's security are inseparable. In other words, they are the same thing.   JINSA's objective is not solely the overthrow of the Saddam regime in Iraq: it also supports the overthrow of the Saudi Arabian, Syrian, Egyptian and Iranian regimes with a logic of 'total war,' and the subsequent importation of 'democracy.' ... In other words, a number of American Jews on the same wavelength as the most extreme factions in Israel at the moment comprise the hawks in Washington. 9)   The Israeli Strategy for The Muslim Middle East   In short, there are those in Washington who are encouraging a war aimed first at Iraq and then at Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran and Egypt. The most distinguishing feature of these is that they are lined up alongside, and even equivalent to, the 'Israeli lobby.'   No matter how much they speak of 'American interests,' these people are actually supporting Israeli interests. A strategy of waging war against the whole of the Middle East and turning all the peoples of the region against it cannot be to the United States' advantage. The adoption of such a strategy can only be possible if the United States is bound to Israel, by means of the Israeli lobby, which is profoundly influential in this country's foreign policy.   It is for these reasons that behind the strategy which began to be set in motion after September 11 and is aimed at re-arranging the entire Islamic world, lies Israel's strategy for dominating the Middle East. Ever since its foundation, Israel has aimed at restructuring the Middle East, making it manageable and secure to itself. The search for security is of course a legitimate one, but the way that Israel chose to achieve this end is wrong: From the beginning, Israel decided to establish security behind an 'iron wall' that would separate itself from the Arabs, and most important of all, protect the lands that Israel occupied through methods of invasion, colonization and depopulation. This strategy of reaping the wind had its consequence as a century of constant clash between Israelis and Arabs. Had Israel chosen a peaceful path to secure its existence, by building good relations with its Arab neighbors and refraining from aggression, Jews and Muslims could peacefully co-exist in the Middle East, as they have done before for centuries.   However, the radical Zionist ideology still denies any chance to peace and relentlessly tries to transform the whole Middle East to create a 'living space' for Israel. It has been using its influence in the United States for that purpose in recent years, and to a large extent directs Washington's Middle East policy. The post-September 11 climate gave Israel the opportunity it had been seeking. Pro-Israeli ideologues who for years had been propounding the falsehood that Islam itself - not some militant radicals who use Islam as a shelter - posed a threat to the West and the United States, and who encouraged the mistaken concept of a 'clash of civilizations,' have been trying to incite the United States against the Islamic world in the wake of September 11. As early as 1995, Israel Shahak of the Jerusalem Hebrew University wrote former Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's obsession with 'the idea of an Israeli-led anti-Islamic crusade'. Nahum Barnea, a commentator from the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot, stated that same year that Israel was making progress '[to] become the Western vanguard in the war against the Islamic enemy.' 10)   All that has happened in the years which have followed is that Israeli hawks have made their intentions even clearer. The political climate in the wake of September 11 prepared the ground for this intention to be made a reality.   The Only Way to World Peace: An Islamic Union   The situation may be summarized as follows: Israel's aim is to reshape the Middle East in line with its own strategic interests. In order to do this, it needs a 'world power.' That power is the United States; and Israeli hawks, thanks to their influence there, are trying to wage a militant American strategy against the Islamic world. Although Israel is a small state with a population of only 4.5 million, the plans drawn up by Israeli strategists and their counterparts in the West are directing the world affairs.   What needs to be done in the face of this?   1) 'Counter lobby activities' need to be adopted in the face of the Israeli lobby's influence in the United States in order to develop dialogue between the United States and the Islamic world and to invite it to seek peaceful solutions to Iraq and similar problems. A wide section of the United States wishes to see their country adopt a fairer Middle East policy. Many statesmen, strategists, journalists and intellectuals have expressed this, and a 'peace of civilizations' movement must be carried forward in cooperation with them. The approach inviting the US administration to peaceful solutions must be carried forward at governmental and civil society organization level.   2) A reconciliation between Israel and the Muslim Middle East must be sought. There are many 'peaceniks', i.e. pro-peace Israelis, too. Many Israeli statesmen, religious leader, opinion leaders and many Jews from all around the world are urging the Israeli state to refrain from its brutal occupation and accept a just peace to live along with their Arab neighbors. Cooperation with them, especially on the inter-faith level, should be initiated and encouraged. One thing should never be forgotten: The rise of radicalism, enmity and violence is bad for all parties.   3) Alongside all this, a deeper rooted solution lies in a project which can resolve all the problems between the Islamic world and the West and deal with the fragmentation, suffering and poverty in the Islamic world and totally alter it: An Islamic Union. Recent developments have shown that the whole world, not just Islamic regions, stands in need of an 'Islamic Union.' This Union should heal the radical elements in the Islamic World, and establish good relations between Muslim countries and the West, especially the United States.   This Union, can find a solution to the mother of all problems: The Arab-Israeli conflict. With Israel retreating to its pre-67 borders and Arabs recognizing its right to exist, there can be real peace in the Middle East. And Jews and Muslims - both Children of Abraham and believers in one true God - may peacefully co-exist in the Holy Land, as they have done during the past centuries. Then, Israel would need no strategy to destabilize or divide the Arab States. And it will not have to face the results of occupation in forms of terrorism and constant fear of annihilation. Then, both the Israeli and Iraqi (and Palestinian) children may grow up in peace and security. That is a Middle East that any sane person should work to see.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------   1- (ed.)

Fat asses, big thighs and jiggly tummies are causes of concern for women striving for that perfect body. As a result, we resort to pills, diets, exercise and a multitude of 'acceptable' weight-loss programs to make us feel 'less fat'.    Is this for health or vanity? How much of why we want to lose weight is because we are grossly unhealthy or because we just want to look good in a string bikini? When we exercise to lose weight, is maintaining a healthy lifestyle a secondary reason as opposed to the goal of achieving a toned body? Then again, does it actually matter? Sometimes, the two reasons are so intertwined that we cannot differentiate them anymore. An example: I only go swimming when it's hot and sunny. No doubt, the main reason why I swim is to exercise. But I also like the tan that I get. That's purely for my vanity. So, although I can choose to swim in the evenings, I'd rather not swim at all if I can't swim on a hot and sunny day. However, I don't like to sun-tan, because I would rather exercise and achieve the tan as an added bonus.     Health and vanity aside, who are we losing weight for? Ourselves? Family? Boyfriend? Or for the pleasure of hearing compliments about our bodies? Of course, no one is going to admit that. Ever told yourself you want to lose weight so that you can fit into that pair of hipster jeans that is so 'in' right now? I have. (But gosh, hipsters don't look good on me) What about that string bikini? Ever want to lose weight to be on the receiving end of an appreciative glance or a wolf whistle? We are our harshest critic. So many of our hang ups can be derived from our perceived weight problem.    Of course, I'm not here to judge, as god knows, I've been moaning about my weight 'problem' for as long as I can remember. The reasons for losing weight can be varied and frankly, it doesn't matter. Perhaps the most important reason is so that we can feel good about ourselves. If losing weight makes you feel happy, then I say go for it. However, the steps to shed those pounds should be through acceptable means. Starvation, inducing vomit and dangerous diets are harmful to the body and more importantly, it is just plain  STUPID .  So good luck for your quest. As for me, my exercise program should be sufficient enough for me to achieve my perfect body. (I hope)          \",\n",

I agree with Frank that the review is, perhaps, &#8220;the   greatest piece of rock criticism ever written&#8221;, but, unlike Frank, Coney Island Baby is   not   one of my favourite Lou albums. I did, however, recently purchase on eBay a magazine advertisement from the launch of the album, but only because I think the title track is one of Lou&#8217;s best songs which is, as  urlLink Mark Deming from AllMusic  has said, &#8220;a song about love and regret that was as sincere and heart-tugging as anything the man has ever recorded&#8221;.

He suggests at the end, that if Lou was serious about the last line, he should do exactly that and stop making records. I&#8217;m personally glad he didn&#8217;t, as much of my inspiration today comes from Lou&#8217;s songs and his approach to his craft in the last 40 years. Perhaps, although I&#8217;m sure Lou would deny it, reviews like this one and the catalogue of reviews from Lester Bangs, may have fired Lou to keep going when many of his contemporaries either died, burned out, or started writing pop songs? Although I find much of his work hit and miss, when he hits, he really hits. It&#8217;s worth the wait. I would love to write songs with that honesty, that sense of poetry.        \",\n",

Two nights of severe weather, got to love it. The part I really like about it is getting to listen to the Tarrant County RACES. They always have interesting stuff on there. If you have a scanner the frequency is 146.9400. Its only good talking when there is severe weather going on. Last night was pretty  good,  hail and everything, but tonight, church got cut short.  Hatchett  stormed in towards the end of class, and told me to give him some power to his  microphone,  got up to the front of the room and said the sirens were going off in Richland Hills [which is where the church is]. So we either had the choice to stay in the HS room, because that&#8217;s on of the storm shelters in the church, or we could leave. Since I was riding with Phillip, we left and stopped by the Diamond Shamrock, on the way to his house to get some a 79 cent 32oz coke. When we got back to his house we sat in his room for about 20 minutes looking at the radar and then decided to go the City of Lake worth PD because the night before Phil was there with Joey until about 3 o&#8217;clock. We sat up there in the dispatch and not much was going on, so we got Joey&#8217;s scanner out of his office, and since the power was out, and they were on generators there was no power in Joey&#8217;s office, so we took the scanner to the computer room, bad idea, the room is like made out of bricks, so we didn&#8217;t get any signal, we decided to go and get an extension cord to set by the window where we got to listen to all the good stuff going on RACES. Once the storm passed over we headed back to Phil&#8217;s and here I am no back at home, tired, and fixing to go to bed.           &nbsp;         Chris       \",\n",

Yeah right. Elderly maybe, but as Kylie shifted restlessly trying to alleviate the pain in her right buttock, she could only wonder in amazement at the mayhem that one hundred sweet, elderly pensioners had wreaked down at the local club only hours before. As soon as the club doors had swung open it had become like the Running of the Bulls as canes and walkers fought with each other in an attempt to be first into the auditorium. As it was, frail, old Nan had kept prodding Kylie in the backside with her walking cane yelling, “Grab a seat up the front!!!!” It had been sweet old Nan who had inflicted the wound to Kylies’ rear end with her constant jabbing. A few more centimeters to the right and Kylie would have been painfully and unceremoniously carried into the Auditorium. In an attempt to try and save herself from a fate worse than death, Kylie had bolted down the long, narrow hallway arriving long before anyone else. The person who had coined the phrase ‘Respect your elders’ had a lot to answer for as Kylie was pushed from pillar to post by old pensioners yelling, “This has been my table for the past 28 years”. One old gentleman had practically gloated when Kylie had given up her two seats without a fight. Not so on the other side. Two eightyish, blue capped women were going at it until two, burly, bruiser types sporting the clubs logo had to be called in to sort the two of them out. Finally Nana arrived and she was not a happy little vegemite. “What’s the good of you? We are stuck behind a pole.” “I…I…” Goodness. Kind, sweet, never out of sorts Nan seemed a tad irate.            “Just sit down and don’t move.” Kylie watched gobsmacked as frail, old, recently hip replaced Nana practically sprinted across the table, wanting desperately to be first at the table where people were already queuing waving five dollar notes in the air. A few minutes later Nan appeared, throwing down a book of cards pronouncing loudly, “You owe me five dollars. Now don’t miss any of the numbers.” With a few minutes to spare before the games began, Kylie watched in fascination as her Nan and a couple on the other side of the table rummaged around in their string bags and pulled out four leaf clovers, rabbits feet and strange little plastic dolls with ugly faces and green hair, placing them at strategic points around their cards. “Legs eleven, no eleven, top of the shop number ninety, two fat ladies eighty eight.” Kylie practically fell off her seat as the caller droned on and on. “Eighty four. Eighty four. Eighty four.” Nan whispered none too quietly. Kylie could only sit and pray for number eighty four to be called just to shut her up. How embarrassing. “Number eighty four, eight fou…” “Bingo.” Screeched Nan beside her. Kylie watched and then started to worry as frail, never raise your voice Nan started taking spasms in her excitement. Suddenly Kylie started getting almost as excited realizing that Nan must have won a fortune. Four dried up chicken wings and a box of crackers later, Kylie was bemused to discover that she had paid out five dollars and that was all she could hope for? Oh please. “We will now have a twenty minute break.” Exclaimed the caller. Thank God. Whoosh. Kylie had to grab hold of the table as polyester and lycra whizzed past her rattling dollar coins in their wake. A few minutes later, Kylie stood open mouthed as Nana emptied her pension fund into one of the slot machines which covered every empty space in a room almost twice the size of the one she had just left. After getting her Nan a drink and a seat, Kylie had the uneasy feeling that she was contributing to the downfall of a much loved relative. Twice she had tried to speak to her Nan and twice she had been rudely rebuffed as Nan poured all her concentration into the ugly little clowns faces which kept popping up in gay abandon. Spare me. Kylie had to leave the room just in case Nan won five dollars. She simply did not have the energy to scrape her Nan up off the floor.  Driving home, Kylie had plenty of time to ponder over the last four hours and she couldn’t help but think that if Hitler had been alive today and had needed to revive the Third Reich, then all he would have had to do was to enlist the aid of the blue rinse set. Bazooka wielding Russians could not have stopped them if games of Bingo offering chicken wings and trays of bananas had been set up at strategic intervals across Europe. Kylie was convinced that compared to these so called frail, elderly pensioners, Hitler was a pussy and thank god he had not had enough  sense to recruit the likes of the Bingo playing pensioners or we would all be sitting here drinking Schnapps and eating sauerkraut at this very point in time. Kylie had just arrived back home when the phone rang. It was Nan. “Kylie dear. About next week.” “Don’t you worry Nan. I know the drill and there is no way we are going to get stuck behind a pole again.”     ',\n",

Using  definition'> replication  , you can distribute data to  different locations, to remote or mobile users over a local area  network, using a dial-up connection, and over the Internet. Replication  also allows you to enhance application performance, physically separate  data based on how it is used (for example, to separate online  transaction processing (OLTP) and decision support systems), or  distribute database processing across multiple servers.   Benefits of Replication   Replication offers various benefits depending on the type of  replication and the options you choose, but the common benefit of SQL  Server 2000 replication is the availability of data when and where it is  needed.    Other benefits include:20    Allowing multiple sites to keep copies of the same data. This is  useful when multiple sites need to read the same data or need separate  servers for reporting applications.    Separating OLTP applications from read-intensive applications such  as online analytical processing (OLAP) databases, data marts, or data  warehouses.    Allowing greater autonomy. Users can work with copies of data while  disconnected and then propagate changes they make to other databases  when they are connected.     Scale out of data to be browsed, such as browsing data using  Web-based applications.     Increasing aggregate read performance.     Bringing data closer to individuals or groups. This helps to reduce  conflicts based on multiple user data modifications and queries because  data can be distributed throughout the network, and you can partition  data based on the needs of different business units or users.    Using replication as part of a customized standby server strategy.  Replication is one choice for standby server strategy. Other choices in  SQL Server 2000 include log shipping and failover clustering, which  provide copies of data in case of server failure.     When to Use Replication   With organizations supporting diverse hardware and software  applications in distributed environments, it becomes necessary to store  data redundantly. Moreover, different applications have different needs  for autonomy and data consistency.    Replication is a solution for a distributed data environment when you  need to:20    Copy and distribute data to one or more sites.     Distribute copies of data on a scheduled basis.    Distribute data changes to other servers.    Allow multiple users and sites to make changes then merge the data  modifications together, potentially identifying and resolving  conflicts.    Build data applications that need to be used in online and offline  environments.    Build Web applications where users can browse large volumes of  data.

The recurring characters have already been stretched in all directions, so they are risking a loss of credibility (risking?) if they go much further.  The secondary characters are beginning to look familiar.  The situations that would in the early books have been almost unbearably tense are now taken in almost without a thought; this is a series, after all, and a popular one, so the author’s not going to let anything happen to one of her main characters, right?  Beside all this—and that is really the question, isn’t it? whether one can see past this?— Ten Big Ones  is a decent book.  It’s not tears-running-down-your-face funny like  urlLink One for the Money .  And it’s not scary as hell like that same book, whose Benito Ramirez is perhaps the best [i.e. worst] bad guy in fiction  ever .  The romantic triangle between Stephanie, Morelli and Ranger might be better in this installment than it has been lately, but it leads one to wonder how much longer any of them will have the patience for it.  The only actual 'analysis' of this book that I'm going to give is to say that if you’ve read 1-9, then you’ll like 10, too.  I laughed my ass off through the last several chapters.  (There’s a scene involving a needle that  killed  me.)  Something about which I’d been curious for a while was revealed.  And the title makes sense.  But if this was the first book of hers that I’d read, I can’t say with certainty that I’d read more, and it sucks to say that.  I'd rate it a 7, based as much on my expectations of what this could have been as for some sort of 'objective' reading of the actual book.    I think it's time for the series to end.          \",\n",
       " '                                                      The     Test       ‘The test’. I realized that everything else was of secondary importance if he failed my test. He could turn up laden with roses and chocolates every night but it would all be for nothing if he couldn’t learn to control himself.    It was a pity really.  Mike had been an incredible wonderful lover, caring, considerate of my feelings and an all round nice guy, until that final date. We had just finished dining at one of Melbournes’ exclusive restaurants, when after a leisurely walk around the Yarras’ foreshores in the heart of the city I saw it coming. Please, please I am begging you don’t. But all the tell tale signs were there, the sucking in of the cheeks, the hacking noise at the back of the throat and then Whammo. My dreams of happy every afters and little Mikes and Megans running around collapsed when a spit the size of a golf ball went flying through the air landing at the feet of a stunned little Japanese tourist who looked as if he had just witnessed the second coming. It was a sad state of affairs when the only criterion my would be lover and father of my seven children had to fill was to be a non loogie chucker.    I am not an overly picky person by any means and all I ask for in a man is little more than a pulse but, ever since that fateful day ten years ago when I had been comfortably ensconced in the family wagon happily envisioning a wonderful day at the beach, I had been assaulted with one of my fathers renowned loogies landing on my face while my mother and sisters had collapsed in paroxysms of laughter.  It was on that day that I had said to myself “Megan. If you end up with a spitter or a shifter then you deserve everything bad that will ever happen to you.” Naturally of all the guys I had dated since turning sixteen, twelve had been spitters and the thirteenth had been not only a spitter but a shifter as well. The knees going down and the righting of his package was almost as much a turn off as the spitting but not quite. So here I was, at twenty two, without a single non-spitting, non-shifting guy in sight.    Perhaps lining up at the local sperm bank was not as unappealing as I had first imagined.    Aisle 3. Blonde, Nordic good looks with a doctorate in Philosophy.    Aisle 4. Slightly shorter than average but with an incredibly witty sense of humour and able to balance a tray of champagne glasses in one hand while playing Mozart on the piano with the other. That would have to be considered as I had always harbored thoughts of having a potential Olympic gymnast in the family. There was no doubt in my mind that surely they would keep on record whether or not the would be fertilizer of my eggs was a shifter or a spitter.     I was certainly in a pondering mood as I surveyed the fridge, wondering what juicy little tidbits I could tempt Nathan with. It was my second date and so far not even a hint of shifting or spitting. Then again it had taken Mike four dates before he had shown his true colours. Punctuality. I liked that as I raced through the lounge room, stopping to glimpse through the curtains to make sure it was Nathan. Carefully flipping aside the lace ruffles, I gasped as incredibly handsome, up worldly, lawyer Nathan spat at the cat while making sure he had dressed to the left. No. No. No. Racing into the bedroom, I grabbed bunches of cotton wool and stuffed them into my ears before laying down on the bed and praying that the constant knocking on my front door would soon fade into oblivion. Oh God. What was the point?    I know I am still relatively young, but surely six years of dating would give me some insight into the male psych. Why is it I couldn’t work out why they spat and we didn’t? I wasn’t so stupid as to not know why they shifted, but couldn’t they go behind a parked car or a tree or wait till I wasn’t looking before they did it? Take me. When I got a wedgy. Did I scrunch down and retrieve the offending bits of cotton from between my butt cheeks? No. I walked around in agony for hours sometimes, risking chaffing and excruciating pain rather than have anyone witness my disgrace if I was to part the legs and go for it. I remember at the age of six when my father had come up to me in the school yard and without so much as the slightest hint of embarrassment to me had quietly bent down and pushed my legs together as I sat there with my undies showing, stating calmly, “Megs. Always remain a lady.” I had tried to live up to those standards and I would no more dream of retrieving those little bits of cotton than I would of wearing blue eyeshadow with pink lipstick. Mind you, I had been known to slip the finger down on a couple of occasions when the grunge look was fashionable. Wearing all those oversized clothes was great and nobody could tell if your whole hand went up your arse let alone two little fingers. How I missed grunge. So I digress. Where was I? Oh yes. I know I am too young to be looking for Mr wonderfully right right at the moment but things were looking decidedly grim if every man I met had the two qualities that had me running in the opposite direction. Lesbianism was starting to seem the way to go although I think I had already been there and done that and it had left me with a strange taste in my mouth. I had been eleven years old and my girlfriend Julie and I would take off for this huge field every weekend and live out our childhood fantasies. Having both come from all female families and having attended all girls schools, boys were a tantalizing mystery to the pair of us and every Saturday afternoon we would fight as to who would play the girl and who would play the boy. As Julie always had the gorgeous long hair and the lip splitting right hook, she naturally always got to play the female. As the boy it was my role to start a fight, then go down on my knees and beg for forgiveness. It was then up to Julie to decide whether or not I was to be forgiven. Sometimes the fight could last for hours depending on Julies’ mood or how long she wanted to make her daisy chain. Always though there was the racing through the knee-high grass, before falling to our knees in a loving embrace whilst kissing each other passionately on the cheeks. At the time we did not   consider that what we were doing could be construed as slightly unnatural until the day we were discovered and my life as a fledgling lesbian was put on hold. My father sat me down and explained that as far as he was concerned I could kiss and pash whoever I wanted as long as it was in the privacy of my own home. Yeah right! As it was, Julie came to school the next day sporting three great welts across her backside and without even a g’day Megan or a friendly smile she slowly and painfully alienated me. I have always wanted to thank my father for not wielding the strap the way Julies father had done. One day. So why did I open up and tell you about that episode in my life. Oh yeah. Guys. Spitting and shifting. Well anyway. Maybe lesbianism isn’t the way to go especially if I want to have children. Oh good grief. How politically incorrect is that? Of course I could still have children. Why, I wouldn’t even have to bump uglies if I didn’t want to. All I would have to do is to arrive at the sperm bank when my temperature was up armed with all the attributes I require in a guy and a turkey baster and then viola. A couple of minutes to defrost, one good squirt and there you have it. Sounds feasible to me and no spitting or shifting.         ',\n",

I'm the one in the right here ! I'm the one who's addressing the issue. SHE'S in the wrong and this is to ensure that I point that out ! So why am I nervous???? Why do I doubt myself so much???  At her first response I thougt he was right about her being dumb. But as we went back and forth, via e-mail, I realized that one of two things happened. Either she's not as dumb as she likes to play like she is ... OR Someone's talked to her and explained that when you have a friend with a girlfriend...and that girlfriend is requesing a private audience with you that MAYBE it's not a good thing and it's got nothing to do with having a 'girl's night out' with her.  Now I just have to figure out how to begin the conversation when Tuesday at 5:30 gets here. That, and I need to ensure that I cover EVERYTHING.  So, I guess that means it's time for me to put my little thinking cap on and start making a list...and then make sure I remember what's ON that list so when the time comes I don't leave ANYTHING out.

       " \"                                                  My Best Protege  I think my protege is the best protege ever.  First of all she is the only protege i have and futhermore, out of all the proteges I have seen that other people have had I like mine the best.  She is the best because she isn't very hard to take care of, she does whatever I want, and she is just like me but not quite as good.  Sometimes if a person has a protege that protege can require a lot of maintenance.  For instance you could have a protege that doesn't really have a lot of direction or anything and maybe you have to guide them a lot or find things for them to do.  My protege isn't like this because she can do her own things with out much help or encouragement.  Sometimes I can help her if I want to and othertimes if i dont feel like it thats cool too.  Another thing that is good about my protege is that she does whatever i want her to.  Like if i told her to do something she would probably do it and if i tell her soemthing is lame then she is like 'yeah that is lame'.  also she will buy me things if i want and she does chores for me soemtimes.  The final reason why i think my protege is the best ever because she is just like me but not as good as me.  The reason for this is because i teach her just enough stuff for her to be really awesome but i save all the super awesome stuff for myself.  For example when i taught her to swim I taught her the breast stroke and the butterfly, but i didn't teach her to hold her breath underwater or how to float.  This is a tactic that I hope she will pass down to her own protege one day.         Because of all these reasons I feel that my protege is the best protege ever.  and after reading this I hope that you agree.         \",\n",

(Guess what kind, haha.) Large turkey on brown with mustard and veggies, no cheese. Of course, I got the chips for Ryan, but he didn&#8217;t want them so&#8230;I ate them. Sunchips, but still. If Mr. Sub&#8217;s nutrition information is accurate, my meal (including the yogurt I had after) was at least 800 calories last night. Yikes. Oh well, it was damn tasty. I went to the gym as well for 30 minutes on the treadmill, but I walked most of the time so I doubt I really did much good. Tonight I&#8217;m going to the doctor after work, so I won&#8217;t be able to go to the gym. Looks like I&#8217;ll have to actually get outside tonight and enjoy this beautiful summer day, haha.

(I was starving yesterday.) After dinner I had some sorbet, then a few spudz later, then 2 packages of melba toast! I was so hungry, I just couldn&#8217;t stop eating. I didn&#8217;t work out, as my body is still fighting back from my ab workout on Sunday, but I did get in some quality relaxing time. I am going to el gym tonight though.

       " \"                                                  Similarities and Difference between C# and Other        Languages     By    John        Godel              Introduction           You should know that many C/C++ developers have been        asking this question: Is C# a new programming language or a new version of        C/C++. My answer to both questions is that none of these definitions is        true. Well, in this article I'm going to go under the hood and show you        that C# is a cocktail of Java, C, C++ and Delphi/C++ Builder from Borland.        Let's first take a look what C# programming language really is.           What is really C# and not?           First of all C# is a programming language. It has a power        to develop software. It is a strong language for network and internet        programming. C# has redefined the programming landscape. In addition, C#        designed with the need of C/C++ and Java programmers. Microsoft created it        with Anders Hejlsberg the former Turbo Pascal and Delphi luminary who was        the most prominent Borland staff also Jbuilder team worked together with        him. This new language has been developed specifically with the  NET        framework in mind, and as such is designated to be the .NET developer's        language of choice. One very important matter about C#, it is the first        component oriented programming language. The hot topic at the moment        though is not its relation to C/C++ or Visual basic, but how it compares        to Java and Delphi. Why Delphi? Because Anders has had a prime role during        C# developing. C# inherits some of it's characteristics from C++ and also        is an object oriented language. C# has the functionality of Java, Delphi        and Visual Basic and it a very strong language. You can not reject Delphi        similarity because theoretically Borland was trying to do the same thing        with Borland C++ Builder working on Delphi. But C# has the most        functionality of Java and C++ and theoretical similarity with Delphi and        Visual Basic to use this Java and C++ functionality in a RAD environment.        You may remember properties term from both Delphi and Visual Basic. On the        other hand, when I read 'C# combines the high productivity of Microsoft        Visual Basic® with the raw power of C++' I quickly remember Borland's        words for introduction to Borland C++ Builder. What does all mean? C# is        not a clone of Java. C# has more compatibility, functionality and        similarity than Java. Also, C# more similar to C++ as a programming        language. C# stay much closer to C++.           Similarity and difference with C/C++           C# is directly related to C and C++. This is not just an        idea, this is real. As you recall C is a root for C++ and C++ is a        superset of C. C and C++ shares several syntax, library and functionality.        In addition structures, unions, arrays, strings and pointers are most        important and similar functionality for both languages. C# inherits most        of its operators, keywords, and statements directly from C++. Enums are        clearly a meaningful concept in C++. Finally I can clearly say that C# is        the first component-oriented language in the C/C++ family. C# constructors        are very similar with C++ constructors. Like C++, methods are non-virtual        by default, but can be marked as virtual. There is also some difference        between C# and C++, C# supports multiple inheritance of interfaces, but        not of classes. Another difference is destructors, their syntax is same        with C++ but actually they are very different.           Most of the C# basic types have the same names as C++        basic types but they are not really same. For example a char in C# is        equivalent to a wchar_t in C++. If you decide to move from C++ to C# there        are a few things to watch out to include the changes to new, structs,        constructors, and destructors. Creating and using a component (DLL) in C#        is fairly easier than in C++. One more thing, Borland's C++ Builder was a        pure C++ with simple RAD environment of Delphi and VB. C++ Builder was not        a new language. This is one of the biggest differences between C++ Builder        and C#. The CLR (Common Language Runtime) improves runtime interactivity        between program development simplicity, security and portability. However        CLR gives usability for cross-language integration. In addition to all        those CLL has+ a perfect foundation for a rich set of class libraries.                  Conclusion           While there are a number of differences between C++ and        C#, the syntax of C# is not very different from C++ and the transition to        the new language is more easy with RAD environment of .NET. Also  NET's        cross language interoperability can give you the ability to use C++ and C#        together Finally, if you want to use a strong programming language like        C++ with the simplicity of VB and Delphi, than you can use C# powered with        CLR.            &nbsp;     &nbsp;    URL of this page is :  http://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive138.html          \",\n",

Got to the clinic this morning to find that me therapy cancelled ...*relief*.  I am such a chickenshit...  But, hell! I'm medicated: so whatthefuck?!!  On the upside, it's midday and I am out of bed and doing stuff; have actually walked about  owtsighyed , bought strudel for the HeffLord; who is also out of bed, stripping in the hallway (paintwork, you sick fuckers), and happi also.  *scratches hed*  Summat's not right wif this pic...?  *shrugs*  So we finally got round to starting the decoratin - which is good (if bleedin messy: not much organisation or discipline involved at the moment).  We now have a nice, clean and paint-free, quarry tiled hall floor - thanks to me, a bucket of hot soapy water, a couple of pan-scourers and a serrated kitchen knife (that is now two inches shorter, and a HELL of a lot sharper, than it was). Took a whole day; me nails are fuXXored; but it was worth it.  I skanky carpet down; 6 to go...  As you might have inferred, the woodwork's being stripped at the moment. It's coming up okay; but needs a lot of arse-achingly tedious and laborious scrubbing after it's been stripped.   Mostly to get out the scorch marks, it has to be said.   So, I'm out of practice with the hot air gun - bite me.   It's a cool tool though - all bright yellow and black and shiny and new. Heff's Dad buyed it for us coz he couldn't be arsed with the hassle of sending us his.   We looooove you, Daddy Heff!!  *does mad little powertool-owning jig with maniacal grin and added whooping*  I have a small 'fession here: I love powertools.   I am a powertooliac.  A powertooliaholic.   And a powertoolophiliac.   (Possibly, I should seek treatment?)  Actually, I need to seek more powertools.  And somewhere to store them, where I can arrange them all in an easily-accesiible fashion - that also allows me plenty of opportunity to gloat over them whenever I feel like it.  Especially now that we have a Screwfix catalogue.   (Credit-card shuffles off to hide, quaking, somewhere it thinks I can't find it)  (But  HA !!! I  know  it's down the back of the sofa!!!)  Who knew you could get them actually  delivered , to your actual  front door , within   24 hours  ?!!?   *madbounce*    Hmmm....it's now a toss-up whether I would prefer books, or powertools, delivered with my morning mail.  I think Heff was a little startled (and a tiny bit nervous) at the reaction the arrival of the woodstripper got...   *grinz*  I want a bandsaw and a hammer-drill now.  Pity we're brassic...  *sigh*  Especially as we missed the munchy-meetingy thingy in Tow-un 'coz of the bleedin cat costing so much at the vet that we had sod all cash left after.

It's nice and sunny, too; so hopefully there'll be pwetty snowfall wifout the inconvenient  icky piles of the poxy stuff collecting on the ground and making everything slushy and non-clutz-proof.

Yeah, actually, they DID have vinyl in the 'olden days'; but, no, there weren't still vinyl-grazing dinosaurs when I was a kid - thanks for asking.  *glares*  More small adventure today: I'm going into town this afternoon - by meself; and on the BUS!!!! - to meet someone I  hope  is still a mate.  (Not Sarah: we sorted all that out. I was being paranoid (cue ironic laughter). Tho, as I said, I wouldn't  have blamed her.)  I'm a wee bit - well quite a lot - nervous about this meeting.  Haven't seen her for  ages ; and a LOT of sewage haz oozed along the pipe since we met last.  She's a really great person, tho; and we'd hardly got much of a chance to get to know each other before all the bollox started and we kinda lost touch.    I hope it works out OK: really, there's no good reason why we  shouldn't  be mates - no matter whatevatheHELL is going on around us.    Assuming we actually  do  get on, of course.  Might discover that, in reality, we loathe the sight of each other!! >=- 0  Heff has just gone upstairs to remove the panel on the back of the book-room door. We're hoping it's a decent Edwardian wooden door underneath  sans  paint: one less lead-loaded-paint surface to strip.  Tho he looks kinda cute wif me black&white 'skull and crossbones' scarf ( the  essential element of my infamous 'Pirate Decorating Outfit') tied round his face, like a cowboy bank-robber! (We haven't got any masks yet).  He was hoping to start on getting rid of the dreaded woodchip in the hall today (yay!!); but the wallpaper steamer needs a new plug.    You have no IDEA how  hard  it is to get a bleedin rubber plug in this bloody town.  It's hardly plutonium, or suchlike; but there are none to be had. He's ordered one from the 'lectric shop round the corner. Hopefully it'll come in this avo: the bleedin wallpaper is really starting to get on me tits.   Especially now it's all scorched, peeling and splattered liberally wif floor-oog.  But, on the plus side, I'm hoping to arrange the delivery of 1/4 ton of gravel from the guys round the corner, as soon as some money goes into my account.  (Sodding gravel's no problem, apparently. There are people falling  over  themselves to sell us fucking   gravel  !)  AND I found a window cleaner who's an ex-student of mine.   I know: this is a weird thing to note in my blog (unlike everything else I drivel on about in here, eh?!); but I have terrible 'burglar psychosis'; and I do  worry  about odd little men with ladders mincing around in my garden when I'm not here and all the windows are open.  So it's cool to have someone I know and trust to clean my windows.  Though it's something of an indictment of the employment opportunities 'round here that a 30something bloke with a good cultural/research degree ends up cleaning windows...  *sigh*  It's nice to know that my efforts as a lecturer paid such dividends for my beloved students.

I really met Meg back at the start of school in lunch. Yeah, of course I knew who she was, but I really didn't know too much about her. Through the course of school and out of school, I got to know Meg better and she got to know me.  If there was a certain event that sealed the deal of my liking of Meg, it would definitely be Homecoming. I remember thinking that I wasn't going to go because I didn't have a date, but on the eve of Homecoming something changed my mind. Whatever it was, I'm glad it happened.   Homecoming was awesome, even though I had Pizza Hut for dinner, I have to say now that it ruled. I went with Heather, Erica, and Kelly, but I knew I wanted to find Ryan, Gregg, Bethany, and everyone else. I found them, and I was content. When Meg asked me to dance with her, I was more than happy to do so. I had a great time with her. Probably one of the most memorable nights of my life. When she left early, I remember being a little saddened. She said she'd be at Spencer's party. Since I was given an anytime curfew, I went there really to just see her. I mean I went there to see everyone else but she was on my mind the most.  I think that was the first time I had been at Spencer's. Probably the most memorable ever, too. I had a great time. I remember thinking about that is unbelievable how beautiful Meg looked, how nice and sweet she was, and how funny and quirky she was. Damn. She still is beautiful and cute, nice and sweet, and funny and quirky. When Spencer finally kicked the rest of us out, it was 2 am. I had my dress shoes on because I forgot to bring some regular shoes. Me and Meg said our good nights and she got in her car. I don't know what came over me, but as she started driving away I found myself running after her in my leather shoes. Now, it's not that easy to run in leather dress shoes because they don't bend like sneakers do. I remember her speeding up and turning a corner. I remember walking back to my car, getting in, and thinking,'Wow, that girl is great.'  I slept more peacefully that night than I think I ever have. When I woke the next morning and went downstairs for breakfast, my parents asked about the night before. For a minute, I sat there, staring off into space. Then I looked at them and said, 'It was fine.' I smiled afterwards and thought 'fine' is not really the adequate word for last night, numbskull. Blissful and perfect would be more exact. That night sealed the deal of my liking of Meg more than a friend.  I think it might have been a week or more later when Spencer pulled me aside in Consumer Ed class. He told me that Meg liked me and wanted me to ask her out. Spencer wanted to know what I thought and I told him to let me think about it. I had already been thinking about it. Thinking about it since the morning after homecoming. I knew I wanted to, but I'm shy guy, you see. Later on that week, I went and hung out with the group for the 2nd time. I think it was Andy, me, Gregg, Spencer, Bethany, Valerie, and Brittan. I'm pretty sure we rented and watched the movie 'Orgazmo'. Very funny movie by the way. I would definitely recommend you rent it. Anyways, while we were watching the movie, Bethany turned to me and asked me about what I thought about Meg liking me. I merely said I like it the idea. Even though I liked her a lot. For me, it's hard to ask a girl out. I mean really hard. Over the weeks, Spencer, Bethany, and Brittan were always asking me when I was going to ask Meg out. I told them before my birthday.    On the night of Elizabeth's Halloween Party, I went over to Meg's first. We talked for a while, then we watched Chicago. I wasn't feeling all that well. I completely destroyed a box of tissues. During the last period of the movie, Spencer called me asking where I was. I was supposed to be at Elizabeth's for the party, but I was having fun just being with Meg. When I left I thanked Meg for having me over, and putting up with me being sick. We hugged twice and I said good night. Had I not been sick I would have asked Meg out then and there, but I felt too miserable that night.   When I got over to Elizabeth's, the party was pretty much winding down. Niki, Elizabeth, and Spencer were on the stairs to the basement when I walked in. They asked me what me and Meg did. They joked and jeered with me a little, but I didn't really care. I just got to spend time with the girl I liked. Sick as a dog and as happy as a cat in a garden of catnip I was. Ironically, Sammy P. was there and she was sick as well.' Two Sam's sick in same room is a bad thing,' I thought. After a while, they gave me some drugs and I went home.  My birthday was coming up quick and I still hadn't asked Meg out.' I'd better do this or I'm never going to do it at all.' I thought. So on November 2nd, 2003, around 9:30 pm, I gathered my wits and my courage about me and dialed Meg's number. My stomach was instantly filled with butterflies. When she answered, I was almost about to hang up and forget, but I held on. I just small talked with her for a while. Then I just said,' Meg, I really like you and I was wondering...if you would like to go out with me.' I don't remember if these were my exact words or not, but after she said Of course, yes, yes, I remember being the happiest I'd ever been or could remember.   So 2 months and 2 days ago, I asked Meg out. It seems both like yesterday and years ago. One thing is certain, though. The amount of how much I like and trust Meg hasn't diminished. It has done the very opposite. It has grown. It has grown past the word 'like.' I have been in a couple of relationships before, but not one like this. Where there are days I can't stop thinking about her. From dawn to dusk, she is always on my mind For Christmas, I got her some things. I already gave her one of presents. It was my poem Days Have Gone By except I made the paper look old and bought a nice frame. What else I got her, you ask? I can't tell you that. It would ruin the surprise.   P.S. Don't forget to come back and read my other post below this one. I just woke up at 5:30 and had to type this. I'm done reminiscing for now. Well I got to go and watch Spiderman now.          \",\n",

Bush declared 'major combat' over on May 1, media routinely refer to the number of American soldiers killed.  But many of those reports dramatically undercount the actual number of U.S. deaths since Bush's May 1 address.  A recent NPR report (8/7/03) was typical: 'These two deaths bring to 55 the number of U.S. forces killed in combat since May 1st, when President Bush declared major fighting had ended.'  A survey of transcripts from some leading broadcast news outlets--ABC World News Tonight, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News and National Public Radio-- found numerous reports that used the same phrasing.  These media are making a distinction-- one rarely explained to audiences-- between combat and non-combat deaths, choosing in most cases to only report the former.  NPR used this formulation earlier this month (8/3/03): 'The U.S. has suffered more than 50 combat fatalities since major fighting ended in May.'  The following day (8/4/03), it omitted the usual qualifier, rendering the report inaccurate: 'So far, 52 American soldiers have died since major combat officially ended in Iraq' (8/4/03).  In reality, the total U.S. dead was about twice that figure, as tallied by the website Iraq Coalition Casualty Count (http://lunaville.org/warcasualties/Summary.aspx).  The broadcast TV networks tend to feature the lower number in their reports as well.  'The total killed since President Bush declared the major combat over: 56 Americans,' declared Campbell Brown (NBC Nightly News, 8/8/03).  In another reference to Bush's May 1 speech, ABC's John Cochran reported (World News Tonight, 8/8/03): 'Since the president gave that assurance, 59 Americans have been killed, 399 wounded.'  CBS Evening News reported (8/8/03) that since Bush's comments, '56 U.S. troops have been killed, including one last night, a guard from the 82nd Airborne, shot while on patrol in Baghdad.'  Some might suggest that using a casualty figure that includes non-combat deaths would portray the war as more deadly and dangerous than it really is.  But non-combat fatalities clearly include deaths that are a result of the war; car accidents are often a result of speeding to avoid ambushes, for example, and the heavy battle gear troops are forced to wear contributes to heat-related fatalities.  As Editor & Publisher's Greg Mitchell wrote (7/17/03), 'Even if killed in a non-hostile action, these soldiers are no less dead, their families no less aggrieved. And it's safe to say that nearly all of these people would still be alive if they were still back in the States.'  In a few unusual reports, news outlets have tallied up all the U.S. military deaths in Iraq.  On July 28, NPR reported that 'the number of Americans killed in action since President Bush declared an end to major combat on May 1 now stands at about 50. An equal number of U.S. troops have died from other causes during that time.'  In an August 9 report on CBS Evening News, CBS anchor Thalia Assuras reported that 'since the proclaimed end of major combat, 119 soldiers have died in the line of duty.'  ABC World News Tonight (7/21/03) reported that '95 U.S. troops now have died in Iraq since President Bush declared the end of major combat on May 1st, 38 of them in what the military calls hostile acts' (ABC, 7/21/03).  Iraqi casualties, especially since Bush's May 1 declaration, are barely on the media radar. Most references to life in Iraq since then offer few details on the number of Iraqi dead or injured. 'Fifty-four American troops killed in the last 100 days. There's no exact count of the Iraqis killed, or robbed, or raped,' reported NBC's Richard Engle (8/9/03). While an exact total is impossible to verify, the website Iraq Body Count (http://www.iraqbodycount.net) lists dozens of Iraqi deaths since May 1, many of whom were killed by U.S. forces.  Asked to describe Iraqi perceptions of the United States, NPR reporter Anne Garrels said: 'Rightly or wrongly, Iraqis believe their lives count for little in the eyes of the Americans, who dutifully tally the Americans killed, but give no numbers on Iraqis who were killed, whether they're guilty or innocent' (8/3/03).  While the Iraqis may be right about the higher priority given to U.S. vs. Iraqi deaths, not even all U.S. casualties are being fully acknowledged-- and that shortcoming applies not just to the Pentagon, but to media as well.   ACTION: Contact media outlets and encourage them to report the complete totals for U.S. soldiers who have died in Iraq, and not just those labeled 'hostile fire' or 'combat' deaths by the Pentagon. Encourage journalists to attempt to count Iraqi losses as well.

       " \"                                             Bill O'Reilly failed in his interview with Michael Moore last week, not because Moore is right (because he is clearly NOT) but because O'Reilly accepted Moore's points of argument as something worthy to even argue about! Here is part of  Rush's take  on the “debate':        [I]n this case, the false premise that was put forth that was accepted and thereby shaped the entire interview, was, 'Bush sends kids to die.'  Bush sends no one to die. The Palestinians send their kids to die. The Palestinians strap bombs on their kids and send them into civilian areas in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv with the express purpose of having those explosives blow up and kill not only the kids, but as many innocent civilians as possible nearby. That is 'sending your kids off to die.' George Bush sends no one off to die -- kids, adults, anyone.  Yet the interview descended into, 'Would you die for your country? Would you die for Fallujah?' and that's not at all an acceptable premise to me. Here's why. We have in this country a volunteer army. Since 2000, particularly 2001, everybody joining the Army knows exactly where they're going. The odds are they're going to go to combat. As such, most of them joining do so willingly. ... But the premise that any U.S. president in this day and age is 'sending kids off to die' is insulting. It is banal. It is infantile. It is puerile. It is insane. It is lunatic. It is absolutely degenerate -- especially in this day and age. Now, people are free to say what they want to say, free to make a movie, do whatever they want to do, and anybody's free to glom on to it and sign on to it and say whatever they want.  But when this kind of thing is taken up by an out-of-power, scared-to-death, filled-with-fear-and-rage political party that used to once be great, and seeks to build its own identity around the lies and distortions and the efforts to ridicule and impugn fine people, then it's worthy of concern and discussion.  ... So I'm not being critical of Mr. O'Reilly here, and I don't want anybody to think this, but I think it is just a shame.  It's just an absolute shame that this kind of whatever you call this -- docudrama, propaganda, whatever it is -- is being accepted and transmitted as some sort of factual, relevant bit of news that people need to shape their lives by or grow up or get up and learn to smell the roses and the coffee, because there's some so-called new profound truth in this movie when it's nothing but distortion and lies -- and this premise that Bush is sending kids off to die, when we have a volunteer force, we have great young people who bear no resemblance to the rabble-rousers of the 1960s, their age then, who are doing this for their genuine desire to defend the country.        Amen to that!      \",\n",

The recipient of the $10 million (U.S.) prize will be the first team to travel safely to space twice within a two-week period on a privately-funded, re-useable spacecraft.                                         Brian Feeney, who plans to pilot Wild Fire approximately 85 kilometers into sub-orbital space, said the team is finalizing construction of the rocket as well as logistical details related to the event, which will be held in Kindersley, Saskatchewan.                                         'We_re very close to achieving our mission, thanks to the organizations and individuals that understand the significance of this race,' said Feeney. 'The da Vinci Project is on the cusp of a new era of space travel for humankind. Our team is proof positive that ingenuity and innovation can overcome the impossible.'                                         Feeney announced a new sponsor to finance the project. Golden Palace.Com, the world_s largest online casino, has signed on as title sponsor. The Golden Palace.Com Space Program Powered By The da Vinci Project is poised to make history.                                         GoldenPalace.com is excited and very proud to be a part of the historic flight of the Wildfire. In the continuing pursuit for innovative ideas for exposure, Golden Palace feels that the Ansari X Prize competition provides the advertising exposure as well as the added incentive of a history-making event that will eventually serve to benefit all humankind.                                          The da Vinci Project, which Feeney describes as the largest volunteer technology project in Canada, has achieved several critical milestones since officially entering the competition in 1996. They include:                                         In 2003 filed necessary papers to Canadian government for launch approval; secure site for launch; tested engine components; tested design; secured a wide range of sponsors, including Sun Microsystems of Canada, Blake Cassels Graydon, ANSYS, Hinz Automation and Kindersley Transport.                                         'The da Vinci Project is emblematic of the spirit of the ANSARI X PRIZE,' said Dr. Peter H. Diamandis. 'It brings together many of the best and brightest to break down preconceived notions on space travel and prove that we are no longer bound to one planet.'                                         Gregg Maryniak Executive Director of the Ansari X PRIZE indicated that the we are working with FAI, the international body responsible for all aviation and space world records, to ensure that the Ansari X PRIZE winner will also receive official international recognition for his achievement. In addition to duration, altitude and distance, FAI has introduced  new world record categories for 'Minimum time between two consecutive sub-orbital flights in a reusable vehicle' and 'Number of persons carried in sub-orbital flight'.                               \",\n",
       " \"                                             The Lilies of Connecticut    By Eric Heppner   Jordan flipped his car off the road during a late clear night in Connecticut. He got out and walked toward a house in the center of the woods. It was a small house, yet when he opened the door it showed a huge open plain that contrasted the night outside with the day within. He entered and the door stood open like a cut in the wind, bleeding wind and leaves through. Jordan walked through the tall grass to a large flat pool in the center. He bent over to the pool and lifted some water to a cut that had appeared on his head from the crash, the cut stopped bleeding and then disappeared. The crash left him covered in bruises and cuts and his arm was badly broken, in hope to placate his pain he slid into the placid pool. The walls of the lake were sheer and the clarity of the water betrayed the depth. He fell through the water as if it were thin cotton sheets. The water finally thickened and he gasped for air as he had been holding his lungs. The water slid into his through and the sides of his neck soothing him. He stopped moving and the water stopped flowing and he felt out of breath again. He kicked his legs but they barely moved and in desperation he arced his back moving a massive tail behind him propelling him forward at a great speed. He reached forward with his hands which were webbed to the first knuckle and very smooth. His ailments had passed away. He swam forward at an incredible pace, the faster he went the clearer his mind. Soon his tail burned as the muscles strained. He saw a light below him and fled toward it. As he approached he could make out a city,  a massive golden city surrounded by awe giving fields of purple and blue and green. The base to the golden city was coral that was nearly transparent as tiny creatures moved in and out strengthening it. He swam to the city and the men and women in the field approached him with awe on their faces. They kept they're distances and whispered among themselves. Several young children raced to the city yelling in a strange melodic voice, that Jordan strangely understood, they yelled victory, victory, he returns, he returns. The city poured with people of every size age and build all of them had wonder etched plainly on their faces. One old man came to him and held an old rusty metal rod. A worthless lump of rust that looked hewn from the car Jordan used to drive, the axle maybe that was so horrible it had cracked and flipped him. The elder presented Jordan the gift. He tried to refuse but the aged man was insistent. He reached out with his strong purple hand and lightly touched the metal and the most marvelous thing happened. As his fingers lightly caressed the jagged metal the flakes of rust melted into silver metal beneath. He grasped the growing bare silver spot with a familiarity that was returning to his hand from a long forgotten dream. The pole transformed into a flowing silver color that looked like a waterfall of platinum without the crash simply a steady beautiful stream. The scepter was fluted on all sides and at the summit was a grand pearl, the greatest in the ocean it held a slight pink hue within its swirling white wonder. From the staff his arm was coated in silver plates that decorated him. His chest was adorned with a single silver banner that flowed with the water around him, and on his head was formed a stunning gold crown that reached to the surface with seven fingers each crowned in a little pearl. He looked over his people of which he was king. They chanted his name yet in their language it took enough syllables to be a chorus of intense melodic beauty. Jordan looked toward the old man that had brought him and he saw the face of his greatest friend. He touched the face of the elder and the age passed from him. He found in the old man the general of his armies, the advisor to his thrown, and the keeper of the city in his absence, his name was Mathew. Mathew became not unlike himself in the beauty and grace of a people of a great age.  Finally came to him one ragged old women. She had a tear in her eye that surpassed the beauty of the city, and the fields, and the pearls. He saw greatness in her. He reached out and touched her face with wonder and mystery and the hope that he would reveal her true beauty. The women shattered and fell away too the ground. The king was devastated at the loss of this beauty and chased after the shards. As they fell to the ground they broke again and again into a fine dust and as they touched the ground. They were eaten by the seaweed that then grew together and formed a glorious white bulb. The bulb broke and pedal upon peddle fell away before the kings eyes. Finally at the very core of the now heavenly flower there sat a maiden rained in white foam with a crown of purple fish swimming above her head. He swam to her and held her head in his strong hands. He lowered his head to hers and as their lips touched all the flowers in all the fields in all the oceans of the world bloomed a glorious white flower The king married his new queen that day on a platform of pink coral under a tent of translucent silver cloth. He then sat on his golden thrown and ruled wisely in ageless beauty with his glorious queen. Every summer after that glorious year the lilies of Connecticut yield white flowers in their honor.                \",\n",
       " \"                                             WHEN WAS YOUR LAST PAP TEST?          It’s a Thursday like any other; but at 11:15 am, the phone rings. I notice on the display that it’s my sister-in-law Manon. I picked up and she immediately says, “When was your last pap test?”  “I don’t know probably 2 years ago,” I answered.  “Well make an appointment NOW!!” she says more desperately.  “Yeah, whatever,” I say.   “I’ll get around to it.”   “I have cancer,” she blurts out. “Quit kidding around, that’s not even funny Manon!” I retorted.  “I’m serious, it’s cervical cancer,” she says as her voice starts to wobble and she starts to cry. All I could say was “Oh my God!”  She goes on to tell me she’s at her aunt’s and she was having a hard time dealing with it at the moment, she’ll call me later.                                                                                                                                                                                    As I sat there stunned with the dial tone buzzing in my ear. I thought, this isn’t real. She’s in her 30’s.  She’s only a year older than me. This happens to other people like your neighbor’s niece or your milkman’s cousin and the people are much older. Her daughter’s only 11 and she’s my 10 year old daughter’s aunt for Pete’s sake! It’s a mistake. It can’t be. It’s way to close to home!       Manon has more energy than anyone I know, she’s always moving or running circles around everyone. For her, everything has to be in order. I often kid that if she let herself go it would be safely assumed that she’d ricochet of the walls. I get tired just watching her.                                                                           Manon is more than a sister in law. We hardly go a day without gabbing on the phone at least 2 or 3 times. She has no siblings so she loves to hear all about mine who live across the country. Over 13 years our friendship has survived more than a few major tests. We are the only two people on the planet that can truly relate with each other concerning the species we call our in-laws. She has no right to leave me alone to deal with them! She’s also one of the most unreliable people I know. Every time she borrows clothes, I don’t see them for months even after countless reminders!                                                                            The dreaded treatments have started. The chemo and radiation could bring a horse to its knees. You wouldn’t know it by Manon though. After the first day of diagnosis, she decided crying wasn’t going to help her or anyone else around her. She’s gained a peace and wisdom rare for her age to a point of being an inspiration to the doctors and nurses who treat her along with many other cancer victims she’s come to know, most of which are much older. They look forward to her constant humor, words of encouragement and support. I don’t know where she gets this strength. We’re all trying to be strong but she manages to make us stronger still.                                                                                                          The worse is over for now. The side affects from treatments are quite evident but she’s not complaining. In fact she’s really excited about going away with her daughter and husband for a well deserved vacation. One month after they had a great vacation together, her liver stops functioning. The cancer has spread. She’s admitted to the hospital and we all understand that she’s not coming back out. There’s nothing more they can do. All she says to the doctor and us is « I’m not afraid of dying, I’m afraid to suffer. I don’t enjoy pain! » We cry and she calmly tells us that it’s ok.                                                              I was able to tell her, while I still could that I loved her dearly and how happy I was to be part of her life. I also thanked her for showing me what strength, dignity and courage are.                                          I spent what I know now to be the last 24 hours of her life, at her bed side.  She died quietly.  I had always done her hair threw the years so I combed her hair for the last time before calling loved ones.               When I kneeled in front of her casket with tears flowing down my cheeks, I also had to smile. She looked beautiful and at peace. The irony is that she was wearing an outfit that I’d lent her many months before. I would swear I could hear her whisper with a laugh, “Try getting this one back! “                                                     I think if she had anything left to say, it would be, “When was your last pap test?”                                                                                                                                                                  by  Monette Bouvier            September 9 /2000               I wrote this story in 2000 right after my best friend/sister in law died....I have been meaning to share it with you. If anything possitive came out of her death it was to really show me  how short life could be and it wasn't meant to live being miserable...hense my total change of life  within less then a yr after her death . Believe it or not but at 37 I had never had a driver's liscense lol so I began taking classes etc, I started preparing for the rest of my life...seeing a lawer, making arrangements with my now ex Michel for our joint custody of our daughter , coming to an amical parting of things and ways. We had been together for 14 yrs but having never married the legal stuff was about our daughter and our possessions , no divorse .I then had to  shopping for my own house to enable me to continue my job as a foster family etc....it was one of the hardest years of my life but it was also the easiest if u can figure that out. I came though all of that with my head held high, my self esteem renewed after so many yrs of not having any at all , but most of all I felt like a new and stronger woman ready for the rest of my life no matter what it held for me.  I knew I had done what had to be done and I had acomplished it in the best manner possible........All who know me also know how happy I have been with Chris in my life. I believe everything happens for a reason. I never would have thought I would meet a man like him or be treated the way he treats me..I wish it for everyone ................I still look up at times thinking of Manon with a smile and tell her...look at me now...bet I surprised you...but thanks for watching over me just to help along the way during those really hard parts...........            So, be happy to be alive...    we tend to not appreciate it  as we bitch and moan about everyday crap... I certainly do...that is why its nice to be reminded of things like this and the perspective of life at times .......HUGS ALL                                                                                           \",\n",

He said he loved the art and especially loved the story idea.  He said that it was one of the better written/put-together submissions that he's received.  I guess that comes from my years of receiving crappy submissions (and a few good ones) for Lucid from prospective artists and writers, and knowing what NOT to send.  Also, he was amazed that I was the one that wrote the pitch, considering that all these years I've worked with other writers and have hardly written myself.  So that made me feel good.  I guess I'm getting better as a writer.  He also said that the pirate theme is great, and especially my treatment of it.  And he mentioned that the company is really on the lookout for pirate material, in the wake of Pirates of the Carribean(since it's gonna be in the market for at least 5 more years due to sequels) so the timing of this couldn't be better.  Stoked!  There are some minor changes to be made, which I expected, and they're very simple to fix.  Stuff like, more clearly defining certain  risque  subject matters, so that it's not left open so widely to interpretation.  I'm shooting for a younger audience for the story, so I have to be careful with how I deal with adult themes.  I totally agree.  Anyways, I'm pretty much on cloud 9.  This rocks.  I'm going to refine the submission this week and I want to do some more color material to include in the packet as well as some more sequential art.  Hopefully I'll get the final proposal in by the middle of next week.  Overall, I've got a great feeling about this.  Everyone pray for me or sacrifice a goat or whatever you do.

I felt like I was pushing harder, and my heart rate definitely reflected it, but overall didn't end up shaving that much time off.

       " \"                                           Being Big.   Being Overweight.  I don't think many people understand it, even those that are living with it.  Because it's a very complicated issue.  You live inside a shell.  I mean... I suppose we ALL live inside a shell.  We all feel a little isolated and detached from the rest of the world.  We're all just these wandering souls separated from each other by these fleshy walls.  It's just some of us have better looking fleshy walls.  It really has nothing to do with whether a person is good or not.  But being overweight, people sometimes look at you like you are subhuman.  Even other overweight people to an extent.  There are all of these awful assumptions that go along with being fat.  You think, this guys lazy, he's complacent, he doesn't take care of himself, he doesn't  want  to be happy.  And the sad part is... it's true.  I believe that even more now that the weight is starting to leave me.  But not for the reasons one would think.  I was being lazy, I admit it.  I didn't want to do what it takes to be thin.  I was complacent, I was willing to accept the excuses it takes to stay fat.  And as painful as it is to admit... I didn't  want  to be happy.  I didn't want to be happy while I was fat.  And I was lazy because I was already fat, and it seemed hopeless to change that.  But the problem is all about perceptions.  I believed all of those things, because I took them at face value.  I never stopped to think about  why  I was fat.  And I never stopped to think about why I allowed myself to remain that way.   Because I was scared to face my fears.  I was scared to admit all those perceptions of me were true.  But when I finally dug through all the layers and layers of doubt and confusion and fear I discovered I was fat because...  ...it was  easy .  Whatever is easiest, is almost never what's best.   'There are no short-cuts in life.'   I was a drug addict, hooked on sugary breads and junk.  And like most addictions (drinking, drugs, sex, etc...) I was using it to avoid what my real problem was.  I was an avoid-aholic.  I was avoiding my insecurities.  I was avoiding my stresses.  I was avoiding living.  If you look at a lot of my blog, I talk a lot about what I'm going to do when I'm thin.  And what I've found out recently is that is the worst thing I could do.  It's dooming my efforts to failure, or at least dooming it to a long unnecessarily arduous journey.  What I realized today, now that I've lost a whole 25 pound sack of potatoes in fat, is that I need to live my life now, like I already weighed 165 pounds, and was built like the rock-house I want to be.  I need to be happy  now !  Because if I don't do it now, I'm only putting off the emotional/mental work till later.  I'm putting off my happiness till later.  And that's no way to live.  See I've been seeing more guys just like me.  Just like I was.  Weighing 250, 300, 350 pounds (or more).  And I see all the things they do and say to try to hide the weight.  I see myself in them, trying unsuccessfully to cover up the embarrassment.  The baggy clothes, the layered look, all black and dark clothes to make it easier to blend into the crowd.  I've seen them crossing their massive arms across their chest to try and hide their man-boobies (when all it does is accentuate them).  I've seen the laughs, followed immediately by the clenched jaw, hoping to not draw attention to themselves.  Today I watched my 400 pound neighbor from across the street mow his lawn and have to stop every 10 feet to catch his breath (despite the fact he was using an automatic mower).  I saw a girl at the pool today walk with a towel draped awkwardly around her shoulders to try to hide whatever it was she was trying to hide.   I saw a close friend (known for his jubilant out-going conversations) go completely silent with anticipation as we approached the pizza-buffet.  Then watched him eat 2 plates full (10 - 15 pieces) of pizza, without hardly tasting anything as they went down.  Then following soon after with a carb-coma severe enough to have to ask someone else to drive.  I saw myself.   I've been and done all of these things and more.  I've been blind but now I see.  And it's very strange to be looking in from the outside for the first time in my life.  So I'm happy now.  I  am  happy  now !  I weigh 165 pounds.  I am rock hard and happy.  I laugh, love, dress and play as though I weigh exactly what I want to weigh.  And I will keep working out, swimming and eating right, until my perceptions and my reality are the same thing.   --Will                                \",\n",

Classic tales of groups of young kids who set out to journey and change the world are still told to the young. Enter our main character Toboe (toe bow A), who has always been enthralled by these stories. He decides to make a similar pilgrimage, but on his own accord. Of course it was easy for him to do it because he was orphaned since his parents died when he was seven. His brother Taita (tie sha) however, has lived with his aunt and uncle since that faithful day, when he was taken out of his mother when she was dying. (Toboe never lived with his aunt and uncle because they despise him, even though he doesn’t know why) Toboe is all about making choices, whenever someone would ask for advice from him; he believes that you should never be bound to the words of a man who doesn’t know your true aura inside. He made the decision to go on his own so that his journey was his own passage (he hasn’t trust many people since that summer day.) His plans changed forever when he went to say goodbye to his brother, and he saw what awful things his relatives were doing to him. Toboe rescued him and let him choose whether or not he wanted to escape his life and go with him. After long thought, Taita decides to travel with Toboe and see the world for what it is.  Now as for me, I’m Vigo, (Veego) the narrator of the story (Don’t think that I don’t play an active role in this story though, I know your dying to see me in action.) Enjoy the story for what it is and enjoy Toboe’s many adventures of the wondrous world of M’iel filled with magic, charm, and romance. Also remember what Vigo says, “No matter where your travels take you, you’ll always end up on top.”                               Perfect Symphonies                                Chapter 1   'Wake up Toboe!'

'Well, what I want is for you to get up off the ground and come to the forest with me so we can get our job done before the head mistress gets restless.' Toboe slowly rose from his once vegetate state, and then gently stroked his hair. He sighed knowing that today was going be another boring day in his meaningless life. Lance and Toboe made there way into the forest to cut some firewood for the fireplace so that all the kids in the orphanage could enjoy some extra heat as spring quickly was dawning on the peaceful town of Almott. You see, Toboe and Lance are the oldest people in the orphanage, (with the exception of the head-mistress) so they took it upon themselves to be the big brothers of all the children.  Toboe and Lance chopped some wood and decided to go to the waterfall before taking the wood back. 'I don't understand you sometimes.' Lance said jokingly. 'I'm not sure I follow you.' Toboe said. 'Well for starters, it's the middle of winter and you decide to go to the waterfalls. Also, it's dead of night and all you're wearing is a long-sleeved shirt.' 'Nowadays, I don't feel things much. Inside me mentally and physically, so there's no need for me to use much needed clothes from the kids. Besides, I'm not going to go swimming; I'm going here to think about things. 'What could you possibly have to think about? There's not much to do in our life besides helping others, and running around annoying people.'(How true)  Lance was confused beyond all belief. He thought that Toboe has been acting rather strangely lately. He's been a lot quieter, not as social, and he seemed to be depressed or that he had something important on his mind. Now you have to be a little dense to not see what's wrong with Lance. (I will explain) Lance is a very plain person; he believes that all he sees is what is real. Sometimes, his 'tunnel vision' constricts him from seeing the real problem within like in Toboe's situation right now. 'That's exactly it Lance! We don't have anything; our possessions are also the possessions of the orphanage.' Toboe started getting exited in his reasoning 'So that supposed to make us happy?' Lance still didn't get it. (idiot) 'Well no, actually yes, it means that we aren't being manipulated by greed for more like most other people. There is only one thing that we possess, that no one else can possess.' 'And that would be...' (His ignorance amazes me.) 'The freedom of our imagination, the freedom of life, the freedom of life. No matter what, no one can deprive us of that.' 'That's some deep stuff Toboe.' Lance finally got his thought. 'I don't know though, sometimes it's not enough. I just wish that there were something more to life than this.' Toboe suddenly lost all of his excitement and started to fall into a depression. 'Come on now Toboe.' Lance went over and grabbed Toboe's arm. He dragged him to the special spot under the water-fall. It was the special place that all the orphans would go to in the summer. They sat on a rock and thought hard about their life. 'You're lucky Lance.' 'No you are the lucky one Toboe. You had your parents until you were seven. I never knew mine at all. They must have really hated me to just up and leave me like that.' He began to cry. 6/21 to be continued          \",\n",

Not surprisingly, Corgan opted to enlist on drums his longtime musical foil and creative spark plug Jimmy Chamberlin, with the other half of the lineup rounded out with guitarist Matt Sweeney (formerly of Chavez and Skunk) and guitarist/bassist David Pajo (formerly of Slint and Tortoise). The group surreptitiously debuted in November 2001 with a series of four small club shows in the Los Angeles/San Diego area, followed by a brief jaunt through the Midwest the following month. Each of these two mini-tours boasted an entirely different set of songs, hinting at the wealth of material that the prolific band had already worked out in their few months together. In April 2002, Zwan morphed into a quintet with the addition of bassist Paz Lenchantin (of A Perfect Circle fame), who joined the group in time for a series of shows in St. Louis and Corgan's hometown of Chicago. These dates featured yet a third set of music, different from the previous two, bringing the total number of songs in Zwan's repertoire up into the neighborhood of 60. After inking a deal with Reprise, Zwan released their first single, 'Honestly', in November 2002. Their debut album, Mary Star of the Sea, followed in January 2003, coinciding with a sold-out, five-night stand at the Metro in Chicago -- the same venue where the Smashing Pumpkins had been laid to rest two years prior. Sadly, the life of Zwan was short lived. Founding member Billy Corgan annouced the band's break up in September 2003, adding that his 'heart was in Smashing Pumpkins.'        \",\n",

It’s a place with a huge extension of peaceful waters, small islands and beaches with white sand and crystalline waters with different types of  blue.  Los Roques is an archipelago of Venezuela, located at 168 km (100 miles), north of  La Guaira. In this place you can find 50 coral islands and numerous low reefs. The most important activities are swimming, snorkelling, scuba diving, windsurfing, sailing or just lazing in the sun.  The days are very hot and sunny all year around. The lifestyle is very simple, people visitors stay in small hotel (posadas). Its principal island is call Gran Roque and is the only inhabited island in the archipelago. It has a little fishing village with only three sandy streets of cottages, a nice dive centre, a few little shops.  A ideal guesthouse stay in Los Roques:    Day 1  Take the very early a.m. flight from Caracas to Gran Roques where you will be met and helped transfer to your guesthouse for a two nights stay on a full board basis. Once you’ve dropped off your luggage you head out by boat with a cool box, sun umbrella and deck chairs to explore the archipelago. You are dropped off a pristine beach on one of the nearby islands for swimming, sunbathing and optional snorkelling. In the mid afternoon the boat will return to collect you and transfer you back to Gran Roque. Day 2  Second full day relaxing at Los Roques, transfer by boat to a different part of the island chain for more swimming, sunbathing and optional snorkelling. If you have a PADI or NAUI diving licence you can upgrade this excursion to a day’s diving, two immersions, for an additional charge. Day 3  Third day at Los Roques, taking the boat for a morning of swimming, sunbathing and optional snorkelling before being transferred back to Gran Roque in time for your late afternoon flight back to Caracas. (Arrives too late to connect with most international flights.)           ',\n",
       " \"                                          One way to make a blue moon: use a blue filter. That's what Kostian Iftica did on July 2nd when he photographed this full moon rising over Brighton, Mass.    - click to enlarge.                The month of July 2004 has two full moons, which means one of them is a Blue Moon. But will it really be blue? Believe it or not, scientists say blue-colored moons are real.            Science@NASA  -- When you hear someone say 'Once in a Blue Moon?' you know what they mean: Rare. Seldom. Maybe even absurd. After all, when was the last time you saw the moon turn blue?          On July 31st, you should look, because there's going to be a Blue Moon.         According to modern folklore, a Blue Moon is the second full moon in a calendar month. Usually months have only one full moon, but occasionally a second one sneaks in. Full moons are separated by 29 days, while most months are 30 or 31 days long; so it is possible to fit two full moons in a single month. This happens every two and a half years, on average.                \",\n",
       " \"                                          Random Thoughts:            Love     It is not just picking the right one but perhaps more so being the right one that will ensure happiness in a relationship.   Love is a creative endeavor, and, like most other creative arts, it is 10% Inspiration, 90% perspiration. Anyone can 'strike gold' in the inspiration arena once or twice, but like so many 'one hit wonders' in the music field, the results pale and fade away quickly. It is truly the self-absorbed and lazy lover who relies solely on the bright flash of infatuation for satisfaction while ignoring the true 'work' of building and nurturing a love that will last for the ages.   Love is an action, not merely a 'feeling.' It inspires and broadens the person who loves, instead of narrowing and crushing the will, the moral fiber and reducing the most sublime of all emotions to a tawdry game of chasing after the next thrill. To love is to put the self and the ego aside often in favor of partnering with the soul, body and being of the loved, of dreaming together, nurturing the separate dreams of each and striving to walk at peace with one's beloved.   By 'peace' I mean harmony, even in the midst of disagreement, perhaps mostly in times of disagreement. For in disagreement there need not be enmity or anger, certainly not hate! To respect the other as an individual of great worth, despite his or her foibles, quirks and outright defects is to honor the commitment two have made for each other. To realize that the other has as much a right to have feelings, opinions, plans, dreams and the right to be wrong occasionally is paramount. We cannot expect to be loved and respected when we trample the emotions, desires and feelings of the other. Greed has no place in a loving relationship!   To keep oneself locked away from the good will and good wishes of  the other is the most intolerable of cruelties. To shut out even the possibility of growth and support only demeans the other and destroys any hope of trust and true partnership. To 'go it alone' in all things, (unless the partner has proven themselves to be absolutely untrustworthy),  serves only to foster resentment, accrue ill will and lead to disastrous and horribly misguided judgement on the part of the closed-off one. For when one lives in complete emotional isolation, things only fester, distort and die off from lack of 'mental/emotional fresh air' and any sense of perspective. Self-will run riot will cause only pain and bitterness in both parties. Better to be hated than to be ignored.  All-in-all, the unrestrained ego, the self run rampant, (despite perhaps some overwhelming 'baggage' and traumatic issues), has no place in a loving relationship, at least if these aspects of personality are hidden beneath a thick fog of denial, rationalization and self-pity. To attempt to go forward alone, without help and support is sadly doomed from the start. Fear must be placed aside, complacency must not enter the picture and thoughts of personal gain of any sort must be banished in order for progress to be made. We all have needs, we all have desires and goals but to be loved and to love in return in the complete sense, which is what we all want is to be willing at least to temper these desires, channel them into something that can at least be appreciated by the other if not actually shared, (though by expressing them one often finds a new and eager ally in the attainment of them, though this is of course impossible if they are never expressed!), and work to help each other grow and develop into the best person they can be. This is not a stupid platitude but the very heart of the true work of real love.  To avoid, evade or run away from this work and these challenges is to deny love itself and to close off any possibility of attaining the true love with the 'soul mate' we all so desire.   True, giving space and 'breathing room' to one's love is absolutely essential as well. To smother one's partner, to shut them out of the possibilities of growth is equally bad for the relationship. One cannot grow without fresh air and sunshine. But this growth must happen within the boundaries of the love each feels, or used to feel, given the moment, for the other. Neither party can grow in love if they feel either stunted or shut out. This balance can be very tricky if there are difficulties either with the couple or with either individual. If the couple has problems, they can be magnified by resentment to a point where they become overwhelming, way out of proportion with the actual reality of the situation.  Likewise, if one of the parties is struggling with personal issues, either current or as the result of the past, especially when this struggle is done in isolation, either out of denial, fear or embarrassment, the problems can be all-consuming, destroying any sense of perspective, of what is right, even the feelings the person has for their partner! The problems become monsters of unimaginable ferocity, gnawing away at a person's soul until all possibility of extending one's self becomes seemingly impossible, until judgement lapses completely and selfishness rules every aspect of the person's life. This is horribly tragic in that help and support are usually right at this unfortunate's fingertips but they seem unable (actually probably unwilling) to just reach out and accept the loving help and support that are there for them, at least if their partner really loves them. To do this would bring about the true flowering of what love is; the unconditional acknowledgment of the person's worth, of their place in the other's heart and life. True, any wrongs need to be addressed and righted, any deceits need to be ended and honesty, complete honesty must rule the day. This may be difficult and painful for both people but it is essential if they want to go on, to realize the happiness they both want, for each other!   This pain, however, will be short-lived and fleeting compared to the joy of building something that is actually worthwhile and lasting, a love that they can look back on and marvel at the difficulties they have overcome and the joys they have experienced. This is far superior to looking back at nothing but a string of failures and regrets!   A love that is true, that can stand up to the storms of life, is the greatest of all treasures. It is something that is built and maintained, not a flimsy feeling that is blown away by the next feeling or emotional blip. It is something that can be looked on humbly, as a thing far greater than either of the people involved, not a 'trophy' to be viewed arrogantly, not a false bauble attained by deceit and selfishness, not a pipe dream of adolescent love songs that rarely deal with the true, sometimes mundane, day-to-day workings of a real love. IN short, love is the product of mutual commitment, of working together, even when you don't feel like it, of being open and honest and supportive of each other, of offering the self unconditionally to the other, knowing full well the risks of being vulnerable but being willing to take them because that is the only way we can ever have the love we all want. \",\n",

Forgiveness is also meant for the people we hate.  Forgiveness is not a word of mouth saying I forgive you. It is an act of choice to embrace the person again. It is to embrace him enough so that he can be transformed by the grace of God.  On top of that, forgiving others now opens the door to forgive yourself for not being able to forgive them earlier.   haha..forgiveness..is a good virtue..work on it...

Do good anyway.  The good you do for Christ will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.  Honesty, humility and simplicity make you vulnerable. Be honest, humble and simple anyway.

April 28,29  Days where I took some much needed  urlLink time  off from  urlLink school  to prepare for the SAT.How I wasted them is another story.    April 30    Day where to my surprise and amazement,we finally got to go to a GSP.The bad  urlLink news  was that we missed the funnest periods,Chem practicals with Da Owl.Also had an appointment with Mamta 'Teapot' Sharma,who flatly refused to 'counsel' me unless I paid up Rs.200.Another instance of the school's highly devious money-making ways.    May 1    Day I turned sweet sixteen,the busiest birthday of my life. Here's a look at my day- 7.30 a.m- Started from my Noida  urlLink home  for the SAT  urlLink test  venue,USEFI. 9.00-12.30a.m- SAT exam.Went of very well,unlike most others.Left me expecting a perfect score. 1.20 p.m- Reached Fiitjee headquarters in Sarvpriya Vihar. 1.30-5.30 pm- Managed to endure 4 hours of classes.     May 2    Highly exhausted after another 8 hours of Fiitjee,I went into a deep sleep between 6.OO p.m in the evening to 8.00 a.m in the morning.    May 3,4  School  urlLink holidays .Completed mounds of past schoolwork,studied for Monday  urlLink Test  and to my disbelief,managed to solve a lot of Fiitjee questions.    May 5   Day of the third phase of elections,with most exit polls suggesting a hung Parliament. After Monday  urlLink Test ,went to meet Siddhartha Basu to pesent him with a copy of the quizbook manuscript and bully him into  urlLink writing  a preface. Accompanied by one of the zillion Headmistresses of Da Factory,Deepa Raghavan,who incidently hails from the land of Laloo.She and Abhinav got along famously,discovering a lot of mutual  urlLink friends  and relatives.We landed up at his  urlLink office  in East Of Kailash,one of the worst residential places on this planet,only to discover that he was busy in a busyness meeting(misspelling intentional).Spent some  urlLink time  chatting with his wife, Anita Kaul Basu,who happens to be my mother's collegemate from her Miranda  urlLink House  days. Anyway ,he did manage to emerge from his meeting and was quite impressed with the quizbook.He showed us his quizzing  urlLink software  ,which he wanted to sell to  urlLink schools .Quite cool.What was cooler was that his team made questions in the same way as I had done,facing the same  urlLink time  to  urlLink time  problems that I faced with their lingo and structure.So now there is another alternate  urlLink career  just tailormade for me,in case I ever want to take it up.  Ran into another friend of my mother's,Rupin Dang,her classmate at Airforce  urlLink school  and son of the Principal.Also into our quizmasters of the CBSE quiz-Aditya Mubai(a cousin of my favourite teacher from Somerville ,Anita Raina) and Kunal Savarkar. This is indeed a small world.    May 6    Day Da Penguin became berserk,asking us to write both a matrimonial and obituary for her.Was she thinking about dowry deaths?????     May 7     Another day of berserk teachers.At the stroke of Twelve,Da Sardar first gave us a horrible mnemonic-BB ROY Of Great Britain has Very Good Wife,then tells us that it is not right ,as he has yet to meet a wife that is good. He then finished a 2-litre  urlLink water  bottle,and then had the temerity to say-  'Beta,itni choti bottles se mere jaise sardar ka kuch nahin hone wala'  He also managed to convert his  urlLink single  35 minute period with us into hold your breaths,115 minutes of 3 consecutive periods.  This was also where we discovered some new names for Odoyo Ki Maa.While some of them were Black  urlLink Beauty ,O/O form and The  urlLink Horse  Whisperer,the one which we found most apt was, of course,  PATALMATA  .This is due to her completely unique combination of orange  urlLink hair  on black body.Accompanied with her hanging biceps from Babylon,she presents a frightening picture ,reminding one of the rakshasinis of mythology.  Savadhaaan!!Patalmata padhaar rahin hainnnnn!!  Also overheard -Sumanlata discussing her  urlLink holiday  plans for Goa with Vandana Marwah. We already know that she is a national level  urlLink basketball  player,just visualise her playing beach volleyball.    May 8,9    Another Fiitjee weekend.Need I say more?    May 10    Fourth and final phase of polling.Most exit polls predicting that NDA was inching towards halfway mark.          \",\n",

       " \"                                          Welp, going along with the asking Alison to arrange some pics theme, here are some photos of when my mom, Tish, and I went to the  urlLink Exotic Feline Rescue  the other weekend.  She loves big cats like lions and tigers and, once she caught word of this rescue (and that it was only an hour outside Indy), she had to go!  We had a great time and really enjoyed getting to see the animals all up close and personal.  I also appreciate that they rescue these animals from people that are mistreating them or from the circus!  When you go, you have a guide that leads you around the rescue (which houses 132 big cats) along these paths that lead right next to their 'exhibits' (I am not a fan of that reference, so I called them pens).  You can snap pics and observe, but steer clear of getting too close or else you might loose a finger or get sprayed (as this one fellow did in our tour group!).  It is a mere $10 to tour and all of the proceeds are used for the rescue.  The tour guides are all volunteer, as well as most of the workers.  All in all, it's a great place and I highly recommend going.  I think the highlight for Tish was seeing that there was a lion named after her!  Personally, I liked the wee cubs (they had 9 6mo old tiger cubs) and the scrap between two tigers (one in a water bin, the other being slapped!).  Grrrrrr......           \",\n",

I didn't get any sleep last night, I don't know why, I think it might be cuz i drank so much tea that has caffine in it??

Now I have to go play tennis in like 30 minutes and I'm really not up for it. Atleast I don't have vb today.

       " \"                                        GitS:SAC is the first four eps of the television series based on the work of Masamune Shirow's manga.     What It's About  In 2030, Major Kusanage of the Japanese government's elite Section 9 fights to keep the Home Islands safe from terrorists, hackers, runaway cybertanks, and machines with emerging intelligence. Oh, and the Major, an ass-kicking hottie, is a cyborg, everything except her brain and spine having been replaced with a machine body.   The Good  The animation is beautiful.  While not quite at the level of the movie, it is still stunning.  Essentially, each 22 minute episode shows more care and detail than any Disney film. The characters are interesting and distinct.  The show has very 'cop shop' feel to it, while the stories are pretty complex and thoughtful. The English language dubbing is pretty good.  The only really annoying voices are those of Section 9's cybertanks, which all sound like Mickey Mouse after sucking on a helium balloon.   The Bad  First, the length of each episode really detracts from the stories.  Each, except for the first, could have easily stood to be an hour long. Second, the disc ends with a cliffhanger, so you have to wait for volume two to see how it ends.    The Disc  The image is nice and the sound is crisp.  There are a few extras (interviews with the director and one of the voice actresses and a few trailers), but nothing too outstanding.  But, this really is a disc to buy for the main feature, not the extras.    GitS:SAC is an outstanding program, both for the art and the writing.  I highly recommend it and can't wait for volume two to be released.    \",\n",
       " \"                                        I and a few mates saw  Bubba Ho-Tep  last night.  Pretty darn cool.  The movie features an aged Elvis (Bruce Campbell) and a man who might be JFK (Ossie Davis) fighting a mummy in Texas retirement home. What could have been a slapstick comedy or a spoof of horror movies instead becomes a fairly serious look at aging,  at what it means to see all your hopes and dreams not fail, but just end.  Yes, there are a lot of funny moments.  This is not high drama.  But it also is not without poignant moments or a dramatic foundation. It also maintains a bit of the dream quality of writer/director Don Coscarelli's better known movie  Phantasm .  I would say it is worth a rental and don't let the meandering pace during the first 30 - 40 minutes turn you off.  While a movie that has characters using walkers fighting a shuffling corpse is not going to become a John Woo-esque ballet of bullets and explosions, the pace does pick up and the slow beginning of the movie serves to build enough of a character for Elvis that he becomes more than just a string of pop culture references.      \",\n",

       " \"                                        Scorpio Sun Sign Profile  October 23 - November 21                      Scorpio is the eighth Sign of the Zodiac, and you shouldn't take that lightly. You shouldn't take Scorpios lightly, either. Those born under this Sign are dead serious in their mission to learn about others. There's no fluff or chatter for Scorpios, either: these folks will zero in on the essential questions, gleaning the secrets that lie within. Scorpios concern themselves with beginnings and endings, and are unafraid of either; they also travel in a world which is black and white and has little use for gray. The curiosity of Scorpios is immeasurable, which may be why they are such adept investigators. These folks love to probe and know how to get to the bottom of things. The fact that they have a keen sense of intuition certainly helps.   It's the Scorpion which symbolizes Scorpios, and it's no accident. Much like the Scorpion would rather kill itself than be killed, those born under this Sign are the ones who are in ultimate control of their destiny. It is life on the Scorpion's terms, too, since these folks promote their agenda (they are quite the executives) and see to it that things go forward. Others may find this overbearing (it can be) and even self-destructive, but that's the beauty of the Scorpion: these folks have tremendous regenerative powers, much like the literal Scorpion can lose its tail and promptly grow a new one. Fearless Scorpions rarely lose, per se, they just keep on going, since they are stubborn and determined to succeed (this Scorpio trait is in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign). Scorpios work as hard as they do so they can someday sit back and feel satisfied with themselves. These folks are intense, passionate and filled with desire. They're also complex and secretive,  so don't expect to get much out of them, lest they become suspicious and exit stage left. It's best not to bet against Scorpios, either, since these folks are surprisingly resourceful.                              Scorpio is ruled by the Planets Mars and Pluto. Mars was the God of War in ancient Roman mythology and is the first (and most ancient) ruler of Scorpio. When Pluto was discovered in the 20th century, it was also assigned to this Sign. Pluto was known as the God of the Underworld in ancient Roman times, so when coupled with Mars, expect some intense energy to head toward Scorpions here on Earth. This planetary combo makes for people who are motivated, penetrating and aware. Scorpions don't miss much, since they are highly attuned to the vibrations of others. They are intuitive, probing and very focused on knowing who's who and what's what. Scorpions can lose their temper (and even become vengeful) when someone gets in their way, so it's best to give them plenty of room. Remember, they're unafraid, and a loss today simply means an opportunity for victory tomorrow.   The Element associated with Scorpio is Water. As opposed to the 'roiling seas' seen in other Water Signs, a better motto for Scorpions would be 'still waters run deep.' Those born under this Sign are as emotional as their waterborne brethren, it's just that they're not as likely to show it. The Scorpio's emotions are repressed, kept under cover. Again, secrets to be used another day. That said, be aware that these folks are clever, perceptive and always in the mix. Their ability to see into things can sometimes be a curse for Scorpions, however, since they can take an insignificant matter and turn it into a huge slight. Beware the Scorpion who feels crossed! These folks can turn vindictive in no time flat. Luckily, once Scorpions catch their breath, they will return to their usual determined and loyal (albeit strong-willed) ways. Finally, while Scorpions aren't above some subtle manipulation to get what they want, they'd much rather take a scientific, even mystical path. The  Scorpio-born are powerful and passionate, qualities which serve them well, as long as they don't let them deteriorate into self-indulgence or compulsion.                          Scorpios love competition in both work and play, which is why they'll air it out in sports and games. Extreme sports are right up the Scorpion's alley, as is most anything which will test their mettle. They've got to have an adversary, since it makes the game that much more fun. The Scorpion's colors? Powerful red and serious black. When it comes to love, though, Scorpions soften up a bit and are caring and devoted with their lovers, even if they do hold on a bit tight. Scorpions are also lusty in the extreme (how else?), so they need to be mindful of their reproductive organs.   The great strength of the Scorpio-born is in their determination, passion and motivation. Scorpions don't know the word quit, which is why they usually get the job done. A powerhouse? Like no other.                                                my website   &nbsp;               &nbsp;                       \",\n",
       " \"                                        The day my life didn't change...   The sky was beautiful and white.  One of those magical winter mornings, where it seemed as if the heavens were taking a deep breath before a winter storm.  The clouds and wind rushed past hurriedly, but with a great sense of peace to them.  And despite a broken heart over the troubles with my dad, I felt a great calm that morning.  I was alone in the house with my little sisters.  And I was in the midst of making something for us to eat.  When I looked out the kitchen window that overlooked the street.  I saw  her  walking.  She wore a big blue football jacket.  A great many sizes too big for her.  She was always small compared to the other kids in our class, and the jacket made her look that much smaller.  She walked with purpose silently up the hill.  Her tiny form dwarfed by the ancient trees looming over the houses in the old neighborhood.  There was great sadness around her.  She kept her head lowered and her arms crossed, and from time to time she would wipe away her tears and the hair blowing across her face.  Every essence of my soul told me to go to her.  That she needed someone.  That she felt sad, alone... and scared.  I wanted to be there for her, the way she'd been there for me.  But as I watched her walk towards me, for what seemed like hours, I began to doubt myself.  I didn't think there was anything I could do.  I didn't think there was anything I could say.  But deep down I knew, that all she needed was for someone to be near and listen.  Someone to be a friend.  But I made excuses to myself... I couldn't get there in time, I couldn't leave my sisters alone, I couldn't find the words, I wasn't what she needed.  But I knew they were all lies.  Because something inside told me what I was supposed to do.  But I didn't listen to myself.  When the voice in your head tells you to trust yourself, and you don't listen, it is a formula for regret.    So instead I prayed for God to comfort her.  I remember that it was the first time I'd ever prayed for someone else.  And I watched as she rounded the corner out of sight.  And I remember thinking that I missed the opportunity of a lifetime... to repay someone for showing  me  the greatest of kindness.  But I let it slip away.  And I've spent every day of my life since that moment, trying to make up for that cowardice.  I help anyone and everyone that will allow me.  I try my best to treat them with the kindness that she had shown me.  Even though I fear I often fall miserably short.  But I can't help but think, If only I'd been there for her, she might've been my friend.  If only I'd made the effort, I could've changed  her  life.  If only for just one moment I could've made her smile.  If only...  that wasn't the day my life didn't change.    --Will                              \",\n",

Four homegrown athletes squared off on the baseball diamond last weekend as Pitt Community College hosted Louisburg College in a National Junior College Athletic Association doubleheader.  Wearing PCC pinstripes were former Havelock High School standout Phil Schandorff and Zach Williams, formerly of New Bern High. In the opposing dugout sat Kenny Flythe--dubbed K-Fly during his time as a Bear--and West Craven's Mike Ange.   urlLink Full Story    NOTE:  Corey apologizes for the appearance of 'hogging' the blog, but if Eric would stop WRITING poetry long enough to POST it, we'd have more of a balance between fictional literature and fake journalism.               \",\n",
       " \"                                       'Waking up is hard to do...'   Okay, so I'm feeling much more balanced now.  I've had a little time to think (and a couple beers).  My new gameplan for dealing with these proposals is to go back to my new rule of thumb  'Keep it small, Keep it simple -- Follow through.'   So what I'm going to do are 5-page short stories.  All completed art, penciled, inked, lettered and colored.  No more of this pitch letter and character design crap.  My magic is in my art and storytelling, so I need to focus on that.  This 5-page story will basically be an introduction to the series, with jokes, character developement, and a beginning, middle and end.  Self-contained, but leading to a bigger story.  If five pages doesn't grab them and let them see it will hit their demographic, then I have no business working for them anyways.  Secondly, I went out and made blue-lined copies of some of my penciled pages that I've been neglecting to finish.  My excuse was that the inks were fading whenever I erased the penciled art underneathe.  And I had to keep re-inking them.  I realized today that I've got too many projects laying-around unfinished.  Stuff that only needs a handful of pages to wrap up.  So I'm going to focus on finishing those this week before I paint and do the submissions.  It will be such a relief to get them out of the way.  Also I downloaded Corel Painter 8 last night.  It's a digital painting program that I'm going to start doing my rough-drafts for my paintings in.  I can paint in the computer a thousand times faster than on canvas (thank you lord for color-theory and 'edit - undo'), so I'm going to do my rough-drafts quickly in that, then translate them into paint.  So there's less thinking involved.  Thirdly, I'm taking out a small loan from my Dad to buy a new airbrush and paints.  I've discoverd that I've been using a textile airbrush this  whole  damn time.  It's designed to  only  be used on t-shirts and fabrics.  Thus, the paints are thicker and because of that it's physically impossible to get the clean 'illustration' style with the airbrush that I've been striving for.  So new airbrush, new types of paints.  I know that will make a huge difference in quality.  And I think working all this time with that handi-cap has made me a better artist, especially when I start working with the right tools.    As you can see, I'm eliminating my excuses.  Excuses are the obstacles we put in front of ourselves to keep us from success.  We often fear the thing we want the most.  -- William... step away from the soapbox!     --Will                               \",\n",
       " \"                                       Author: Ann B. Ross   Genre: Mainstream Fiction/Mystery/Humor    Review:   Those keeping a close watch on my reading habits may have noticed that I'm drawn to reading clusters of books by the same author.  The truth is that I can't let go of characters I liked and  must  read every book where their name is uttered or else I feel in some way incomplete.  I believe blame for this malady may be placed on my mother who purchased for my very first  urlLink  Baby-Sitter's Club   book back in the day.  That book started a sick obsession with fictional characters--so much that I wished that I was one of them.  Oh, to be a baby-sitter with insignificant problems and yearly vacations...*sigh*  Sick obsessions aside, my adult tastes have changed every so slightly, and while I no longer get my rocks off on teeny bopper three-hour novels, I do scratch and bite over books like the  Miss Julia  series because I still am unable to let go of characters I like.  Although I'm not typically a fan of mystery novels, I didn't realize this  was  one until after I finished it--a little temporary brain-fartitude for ya.  While in the first book in the series,  Miss Julia Speaks Her Mind  established that the Southern woman's place is  not  one of Civil War era of servitude to everyone but herself,  Miss Julia Takes Over  is a humorous reminder that taking the high ground is harder but will create less dirt to sweep under the rug.  As a woman, I also caught Ross's subtle hint that jealousy may be a useful tool in driving a lady to  beat the crap out of some skank  acquire the gentleman of her choice.  For those more interested in Lillian, Lloyd, and Hazel Marie, they return as well with their usual mannerisms and quirky conversational traits.  I could just wrap them up with a little bow and love them and squeeze them and ... name them 'George.'   Verdict:     Fine literature?  No.  But I love Miss Julia.  I can think of a couple of people just like her...  It's a good beach read.  Incidentally, if you go to the beach, I'd like to come.  I promise to be very quiet.         \",\n",
       " '                                       CHAPTER 1 What ever happened that day had been a mystery to Sirius. He had just been a by stander, a looker on. Well he enjoyed it, was that wrong? Was he being a bad friend to James? No of course not, he thought, as he walked the silent corridors that led to the astronomy tower at so late an hour.   He had to go there. He had to go over everything that had happened. Was he just hoping that it had happened or had it been real?  Six years of knowing James had it for Lily Evans didn’t change the fact that in the back of his head, he too had a thing for the petite and saucy red head. The fact that she had it for him too was almost too much.   Going back several hours to the events of that day Sirius thought over the absurdness of it all. Going there so much to stare out the massive open windows that were more like gateways to the sky, was where you would find Sirius when he wasn’t joking around with his fellow Marauders. Sirius, though he never admitted it to anyone let alone himself, had a serious side. Whenever he went up to the astronomy tower outside of class, he would stare out at the horizon and think about his family and how he was shaping up to be the “white sheep” as it were, and many of his other woes.   Though proud to be a Gryffindor Sirius always wondered, shouldn’t he be more like his family, and if so why wasn’t he? Oh well that wasn’t on his mind at the moment. What, or really who, was on his mind was Lily.  Sirius had gone up the astronomy tower earlier to think as usual, but not as usual, he wasn’t the only one up there thinking. Sitting with her legs dangling at least one thousand feet off the ground, staring out the window was Lily Evans.   “What’s this Evans?” he had said to her on sight. He had startled her, but what did he care, that was his job, to be on her bad side with his good-hearted but sometimes cruel humor. “Lost your way? Potter’s down at Quidditch.” She looked up at him with those green eyes of hers, and something was different about them. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it, but there was something there he hadn’t noticed before.  “’Lo Black.” She had said as he had walked over and sat down in the same window but not quite beside her.   “What brings you up here Black?” she had asked him. He watched her; she wasn’t being mean, or nice for that matter. Something was up.  “I’m up here to think my dear Miss Evans.” He had said with a grin and lay back with his head resting head on his hands. “Now what brings you up here Lils?” he had asked in returned. He had watched her out of the corner of his eye, but hadn’t acted very interested.   “Same reason.” She had said simply. Lily had then let out a small sigh. “May I ask you a question Black?” He tilted his up to get a better view of her when she asked this. What could she have to ask him?   Sirius stopped he was at the door of the astronomy tower again. “What a question!” he exclaimed. He went over the question again in his mind for maybe the hundredth time since she asked it. ‘Yes I have gone out with many girls.’ He had said in reply. ‘Didn’t really like many of them.’   “Does James really like me as much as he says he does?” she had asked next.   “In a manner of speaking yes, and he makes sure no other guys try to ask you out.” He had told her. It was the truth. The next events and things said after that defied James and his trying to be the only guy to ask Lily out. What had ended up happing was a kiss between Sirius and Lily.                                      CHAPTER 2 Sirius couldn’t rightly remember exactly how it had happened or what they had said. All he knew was that at one point he and Lily were kissing and he was to meet her there now. He stared at the door. Should he open it and become an even worse friend? He couldn’t decide. There were many reasons why he shouldn’t open it. James was his best mate. James had always fancied Lily, and had told Sirius so hundreds of times a day. But on the other hand, Lily obviously didn’t like James, she liked him Sirius, she had told him so. Sirius thought this over.  He had always thought that Lily had actually fancied James as well; she just didn’t want to admit it. Those two were always fighting and it just seemed like it was sexual tension to Sirius. The tables had turned in the favor of Sirius. He always took up such great opportunities as these, but he had his own little fan club, did he really need Lily? Maybe James would never find out and Sirius could have his cake and eat it too?   “Ah Prongsie! How could I do that to you?” he muttered, his loyal side showing through. James was like his brother, he was his best mate, and he couldn’t do this.   “Maybe I was wrong,” he sat down on the top step and leaned back against the door. Dark hair fell into his eyes with ease giving him the look deep thought, which for once in his life was what actually was going on behind his dark brown eyes. He rubbed his chin as he thought; this was a tight fix. Gain and lose, lose and gain.  “Oy Padfoot!” Sirius jumped at being disturbed from thought. ‘That voice, so familiar…’ mentioned the little voice in the back of his head. He looked up.  “Prongs!” He acknowledged his best friend with a mixture of shock and relief. “What’d you upta?” he asked trying to hide his anxiety.  “Lookin’ for Evans, what else?” said the hazel eyed boy as his hand shot up to his already messy raven hair and gave it rumple completely missing his friend’s unenthusiastic and worried tone. He grinned. “Good ole’ Evans, always in an interesting spot, what brings you up ‘ere mate?”   Sirius thought for a moment, he couldn’t tell him the truth, but he couldn’t lie to his best friend.   “Jus’ thinkin’,” he said simply ending his dilemma of what to tell James. “What makes you think Evans’ll be up ‘ere?” he hid his nervousness well.  “Oh she’s up ‘ere alright. Saw her leave myself, waited a bit you know, jus’ ta make sure.” James glanced at the door. “Reckon she’ll come ‘round today?” he asked his friend hopefully.  “ ‘Course she will, James.” Sirius gave him a forced grin and hoped it looked real enough for James’ sake. “If not today, there’s always tomorrow. You two are meant for each other, I’ve always said.” He half-heartedly added. “Thanks mate, keep your fingers crossed.” James made for the door and opened it cautiously. After peering inside he looked back to Sirius. “I was right, she’s up ‘ere.” He whispered and opened the door widely now.   Sirius looked in the doorway. There she was sitting by the same large window as before, but she looked as if she done something different with her hair. Her stunning green eyes turned to them. Sirius almost couldn’t bear it. He couldn’t like Lily, she and James really were meant for each other, despite her objections. But what about himself, didn’t he have someone meant for him? Why couldn’t it be Lily? They would make a right pair the two of them…but so would she and James.   Sirius looked away from those big green eyes, she was for James, and he knew it and he had to accept it. He looked over at James who was already jabbering to Lily, happy as a clam, his eyes adoring her as much, no more than Sirius’ had.   “—Right, right Evans, studying the sky are ya so late at night when we don’t even have Astronomy tonight?” James was saying when Sirius finally tuned back in.   “Oh give it a rest Potter!” Lily said exasperatedly. “Why are you up here? Better view of the Quidditch field?” she shot icily.  “Nah Evans, thought I might catch a beautiful sight, and seems I have.” James said with a mighty grin and winking at Lily.   Lily rolled her eyes and stared back out the window. “Why don’t you fall off your broom and break you neck Potter, you’ll be doing us all a great favor.”   “Ah Evans, you know you like me,” James strode across the room and stood with his back to the window his elbows resting on the sill just by Lily grinning at her. “Admit it.”   Sirius just watched. He could see that neither of them was about to give up and give in to the other. This was painful for him. Watching Lily being hit on by James had always given a twinge of grief, but now he couldn’t stand it.   “Why don’t you to just snog and get it over with!” he bellowed at the two of them angrily. “Lily, you know you like him, and James put a sock in it before I jinx you!” he stormed out of the room slamming the door and crashing down the steps. His feet soon brought him to the Portrait of the Fat Lady.   “Out so late are y—“ the Fat Lady began but Sirius cut her off.  “Fizzing Whisbees.” He said curtly and she swung open before she could finish her sentence. Sirius stormed over to one of the over stuffed chairs in the shadows, flung himself down into it and stared moodily into the fire.                                                                CHAPTER 3 Sirius didn’t know how long he sat there. It had already been late, but now faint signs of the rising sun were starting to appear. He was wallowing in his emotions, thoughts buzzing around his head so violently he couldn’t really get a hold on one at all.   The portrait door swung open. Lily walked in first, looking quite flustered followed by James, who looked quite disappointed. The still fresh internal wound began to sting once more. He looked away from them both as Lily sat down in a chair not to far away, crossing her arms in a huff.  “You know we almost got caught, Potter, and its all your fault!” Lily shot at James icily.  “You were up there before I was, I didn’t do anything to you! What were you doing up there anyway?” James sounded quite flustered himself. He flung himself down in the chair opposite to Sirius, but was still looking over at Lily. This was no problem for Sirius; he didn’t want to talk to James anyway.  “None of your business Potter, now, if you please leave me alone!” she stood up and started for the girl’s dormitory. “I’m going to bed, luckily tomorrow is Sunday!”   James’ eyes followed her up the stairs as Sirius noticed out of the corner of his eye. They sat there in silence for a view moments before either of them talked. It was James who spoke first.  “What’s with her?” James asked finally turning to Sirius.  “Dunno…how long were you up there?” Sirius asked, hoping that it wouldn’t sound like he actually cared.  “Well…we got into a bit of a row as soon as you left…and heard Filch and had to get back with out gettin’ caught…by the way why were you so mad?”   “Er—no reason…jus’ tired I guess….” Sirius lied giving a fake yawn. He didn’t look at James, he couldn’t. He forced a grin and looked at the spot right above James’ head so it wouldn’t look quite suspicious. “So no luck with Miss Evans then eh?” he tried to sound like he would have if he actually cared, or rather like he didn’t want James to have had any luck at all.  “No…” the disappointed look returned to James’ already tired face. He yawned and stood up. “Well I suppose I’ll go to bed then, might get an hour or two in before lunch.” He smirked and headed up the stairs to the boy’s dormitory. “Night.” He called over his shoulder to Sirius.  “Night.” Sirius muttered as James was up the stairs. Though he hadn’t slept in way over twenty-four hours Sirius felt no more tired than he had been at any time he could remember. He sat in the over stuffed chair as the light steadily increased from pale grey to the brilliant rays of the morning sun. Several people had filtered into the Common room now but it was fairly empty still.  A small thud of someone walking the steps came from somewhere behind Sirius, startling him a bit. He turned round to face one of few people he had thought he would, or really wanted to.   “’Mornin’ Evans.” He said coolly. His dark eyes followed her to the seat opposite him. From the looks of it she had been up for long, and was still in her pajamas. She emitted a small yawn before answering him.  “’Morning. Please do tell me why you decided to leave me there with that git!” she demanded of him immediately. “You do know I don’t fancy him in the least!” she indignantly stuck out her chin and crossed her arms.  Sirius studied her startling green eyes with a surprised expression. The dark red hair fell pleasantly to her shoulders was slightly messy as if she hadn’t done much to it since she had awoken.  “Well I would think for someone who regards their intelligence as highly as you regard your own that you would have deduced that already.” He said haughtily with a hint of coldness behind it.  “No I have not figured why you got so flustered at me and James having a go at one another!” she shot brushing her hair back, ridding it of the signs messiness.   “Too bad, I—“  “You’re worse than he is! Jealous, that’s what you are!”  “Of my best mate?” Sirius was astonished at her guessing so quickly.  Lily nodded “Mhm. Of course, it wasn’t that hard to figure. You aren’t the hardest to read now are you?” she smirked slightly at this, her eyes resting on him now.  “You believe your right then?” He raised an eyebrow at her.  “—Yep—“ She nodded.  “—You sure bout that Lils?” He stroked his chin now watching her intently.  “—Mhm.” She nodded again.  “Well I’m not jealous!” Sirius crossed his arms and glared at her.  “Yes you are! Want me to prove it?”  “Go ahead!”                                      CHAPTER 4 “Okay.” Lily lifted her chin defiantly. “Find me Potter and let the games begin. Driving a wedge between the infamous duo of Black and Potter will be the highlight of my life.”  Sirius gave her a bark like laugh and stood up. “Very well my fair Lily. OY PRONGS! GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE!!!” he bellowed loudly making Lily flinched slightly.   The door to the boys’ dormitory swung open and a pajama clad James walked out yawning widely and scratching the back of his head. He stumbled tiredly down the steps and over in Sirius and Lily’s general direction.  “Eh?” he managed through another yawn. He blinked a bit and noticed Lily. “Morning Lily.” He grinned stupidly at her.  “Morning James.” Lily smiled at him her eyes flashing. She smirked over at Sirius and then to the amazement of everyone in the Common Room, especially James and Sirius, moved closer to James, wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling her self up slightly onto her tiptoes and proceed to press her lips against his for several seconds before letting go breaking the kiss.   Sirius, as well as James, stood gawking at Lily. James sported a stupid grin and was the first to speak.   “Wow!” he raised his hand to his lips. “WOW!” he repeated. “Um…. GOOD morning!” he grinned ear to ear.   “What is wrong with you Lily?” Sirius suddenly shouted grabbing her by the shoulders and turning her to face him. “Are you mad? You kiss me then you kiss James! Who do you like? What does this prove? How could you—Why would you--Damnit all Evans, I thought you liked me!”   Lily only smirked knowingly up at him. “Later boys.” She said raising her eyebrows at the both of them and walked out of the common room.   “Uh…. Sirius?” James said after several minutes of silence. “Did Lily actually kiss you or did you kiss her?” he practically accused.  Sirius glared over at James. “What do you think?” he said coolly through gritted teeth. He wanted to tear James limb from limb and James’ feelings were mutual.  “I think you kissed Lily, who you know I’ve fancied for years, and have been trying to get to like me for years, and—“ Sirius cut him off.  “Is it my fault she doesn’t like you, and likes me?!” he yelled at his former best friend.  “I’d watch your back if I were you these days, Black, just might get what’s coming to ya.” James glared at Sirius, his hazel eyes full of fury.  “Sure, Potter, Sure.”   With that they both stormed off in separate directions, James back up to the dormitories and Sirius over to the portrait hole. The few people in the Common room watched them both muttering amongst themselves, shaking heads, tutting and other such things. It was a sad day in Hogwarts history when the two greatest pranksters Hogwarts had ever known had a row of a century over a girl.    Lily sat in the library thinking over what she had just done. Bout time those two figured some things out. She thought. See Lily’s plan had nothing to do with breaking up the Marauders, as it must have seemed. Though she greatly disliked James she would never be so mean as to set he and Sirius against each other for no reason. The fact of the matter, she didn’t even like Sirius that much either, well not in that way at least, and she was hoping that they’d both understand why she was doing this eventually.  “Lily, a word?” came a stern voice from behind her. It was Remus Lupin, her favorite of the Marauders, obviously here to talk to her about what she had just done.  “Before you say anything Remus, please know that I have my reasons for this, and you of all people should understand why I am doing this.”  “Of course! I came here to help you! Now what can I do?” Remus grinned at Lily’s surprise and sat down opposite of her. By the end of an hour they were both completely prepared and informed of the plan and ready to follow through.   “Great Lily! Brilliant! And I must say about damn time!” Remus applauded her as he brushed the golden brown hair from his eyes and beamed at her.  “Thank you! Now let’s get this thing over with! I don’t know how much I can kiss those two before I explode!” she giggled and they both stood up smiling and left the library. James sat on his bed thinking determinedly. A hand rested on his lips as he thought about what had happened a mere twenty minutes ago, but wait it hadn’t all been good.  “I’m gonna kill Sirius Black!” he exclaimed out of nowhere and stood up. He rushed over to his trunk and started to pull of school robes and hastily put on. He then stormed out of the room with a look of defiance set on his handsome features.                                  CHAPTER 5 James and Sirius didn’t have an incident for the rest of the day. They did of course meet a few times in the common room and dormitories but there were only hateful glares but no words. James’ vow to kill Sirius was put off until he came up with a good plan on how to do it, or that was what he decided as he changed for bed.  The day ended sourly and the night in boys’ dormitory was not the most pleasant ever in that room. The enmity between the two sixteen-year-old boys was so pronounced that the air was thick with it. The other sixth year Gryffindor boys ignored it as much as possible and slept as only boys can through such times.   The following week, aside from a few taunts and bickering, was quiet enough. James and Sirius glared at each other but stayed out of each other’s way. Lily and Remus decided that for the moment there was nothing they could do to further along the plan except let life go on. So when the second Monday after it happened rolled around they weren’t as on their toes as they should have been.   The Gryffindor entered the potions dungeon in a large group that day. Sirius and James were as far away from each other and as close to Lily as they could be doing both.  The group had nervously made there way down to the dungeons ready for a fight.   Because of recent events when the Gryffindors took their seats Sirius and James were left standing because they refused to sit with one another. The only seats left were by Frank Longbottom and…Lily Evans.   Frank Longbottom. A tallish, smart Gryffindor sixth year who played a chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and was a fairly good friend of the Marauders, but had of late been more interested in Alice Prewett and was getting the elbows and chuckles of his fellow male classmates for sometime now.  The other boys weren’t into the whole romance thing like Frank was, but maybe they should have been considering most of the Gryffindor fifth and sixth year girls were dating Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, well the ones that weren’t stalking Sirius. So maybe they should have taken a lesson from him.  Now it wasn’t that neither of them disliked Frank in anyway but they both wanted to get to Lily before the other had a chance to. Sirius was still a little mad a Lily but he was more concerned with the competition with James, and the same went for James as well.    The other Gryffindors watched them carefully out of the corners of their eyes, Remus and Peter watching the closest. Knowing James and Sirius this could go one of three ways. Wands, fists, or both. Now even the Slytherins were noticing the tension between the former best friends. Before anything could happen the professor walked in.   “Mr. Potter, Mr. Black. Take you seats so we can begin.” The professor gave them both a significant glare to show them that he meant it.  Sirius and James eyed each other for a moment before taking the seat nearest to them. Consequently the seating ended up with Sirius and Frank and James and Lily.   Halfway through the class James leaned back to Sirius and Frank.  “Wishing you were me Black?” he whispered which a menacing sneer from Sirius. James kept making a point to bump into Lily’s hand and other various body parts in just a way to get on Sirius’ nerves.  An hour or so later the Gryffindors plodded up the corridor leading out of the dungeons   and up to the Great Hall for lunch. The main thought going through the minds of the Gryffindors was why hadn’t James or Sirius taken the other out yet?  ‘Oh damn, I’m not sure this was the best idea… but they have to learn.’ Lily watched them both as closely as possible, which wasn’t hard, them both being a good seven or eight inches taller than her each and bother on either side of her. They weren’t too hard for her to spot.   ‘What if it doesn’t work? Where’s Remus? He’s supposed to be here help!’ Lily watched for Remus anxiously and kept an eye on James and Sirius as well as she could. ‘At least he should here to keep them from fighting, which is what’s bound to happen any second— Damn.’   The clock’s loud ticks and tocks added to the suffocating silence in a way to drive anyone mad. Sirius sat on a cot with a black eye, a swollen lip, and what looked like several broken ribs, not to mention a splitting headache as well, and James lay in the bed beside him still unconscious.   The events of the hours before played in his mind like one of those annoying muggle movies Arthur Weasley and Lily had always talked about. Arthur had been gone for several years but Sirius still remembered all about those bloody movies.   ‘The stupid projectors and wide screens, Arthur was so nuts. He’s working for the ministry I think, in something that has to do with muggles. He was a nice bloke. He was married now, to oh what was her name, oh yeah that red head Molly…Molly uh…. well Molly Weasley now. They had a kid didn’t they? Uh Charlie I think it was or Bill, maybe they have two…oh well…’  Well that’s how he was seeing the “disaster” now every time he closed his eyes, like a muggle movie. Sirius closed his eyes tightly, deciding that he needed to go through the “disaster” to see where it had gone wrong.   There had been less than ten feet left before the Gryffindors would have reached the Great Hall. The relief was so obvious on everyone’s faces you could almost taste it in the air, they had come this far with out an incident. That’s when it happened. Some how, it seemed, that James toppled down and took Lily down with him. From the look of it, or to Sirius rather, James was jumping Lily, which wasn’t a very James thing to do, but it didn’t matter to Sirius. It ended up being the straw that broke the camel’s back.   Sirius bent down and pulled James up off of Lily and before James had a chance to say anything, Sirius gave him a good hard right hook. James wasn’t the type to takes things laying down so within seconds there was a full blown out fist fight between the two young men. Their wands forgotten in their robes, fists everywhere. In the end it some how ended up with them both unconscious and some how they were brought up to the Hospital Wing. That was where Sirius sat now.  The tension had definitely escalated to a remarkable point.    ',\n",
       " \"                                       Dream Traveler   So before I turn 30... a little less than 3 years from now, I want to start traveling pretty regularly.  One of my first stops is Boracay, a small island in the Phillipines.  I plan to spend a month or two there.  It's got to be one of the most beautiful places that I've ever seen.  I think to be a good writer, you need to travel a lot.  And observe the world and the people in it as they live.  You need to be able to 'paint with words.' So that's my excuse for going to paradise.                                            urlLink     One of the next places I'm going is the Cinque Terre in Italy.  I actually want to live there for at least 6 months to a year.  My goal is to paint and write almost exclusively.  If learning to do art on my own the last 5 years were my college education, the Cinque Terre would be my graduate degree.                                             urlLink     The third, and probably not the last, place that I plan to go in the next 3 years, is to Portugal.  I want to walk the pilgrimage of  El Camino de Santiago  in Portugal.  It's a very spiritual and personal journey.  And I think before I go into the next decade of my life, it's very important to reflect on the path I've followed.  I don't have any pictures of the Camino... mostly because I'm waiting to see it with my own eyes.  And I don't think any picture could do it justice.   --Will                                \",\n",

That is the topic of this blog...CORPORATE WORK PSYCHOLOGY.        &nbsp;        &nbsp; Its very fun to watch human beings making a comment about other human beings. People        in a meeting never ask the same question and never share the same thought (sounds like a theorem).        &nbsp;        Well its all about mindset people have. Most of them do not have open mindedness.        &nbsp;        Why is this happening? Why can&#8217;t people free their mind?        Why can&#8217;t there be a dream corporation where everybody gives hand to everybody for advantage        of their individual development and that of the corporation.         &nbsp;        Corporations boast that they have great team which can deliver what they want&#8230;that&#8217;s it&#8230;that&#8217;s        What corporations are concerned of the damn end result. But do they know what goes on the mindset of an individual        in that team, the sub team members which is formed by neglecting a particular individual who is smart, out of the box        and finally the team as a whole which finally contributes the end result.        &nbsp;        Well there might be some formula for this of how the weightage to the end result counts.        &nbsp;        Here goes a fictious formula        0.4* (Sub-team contribution ) + 0.4 * (Smart individual contribution) + 0.2 * (Whole Team contribution) = END RESULT        &nbsp;        Well&#8230;got anything from this&#8230;I write more about this in my next BLOG        &nbsp;        &nbsp;     ',\n",

       " '                                      In   SOME THOUGHT ON CORPORATE WORK PSYCHOLOGY - PART 2   we were analyzing &nbsp;the roles a        person plays in a meeting        &nbsp;        This blog is a continuation of that subject.        &nbsp;          ROLE 2 ANALYSIS:          &nbsp;        &nbsp;This person has more knowledge and less contribution.        &nbsp;        Seems to be fine because he has to let others participate and ask questions.        This role is played by experienced people attending New Guy training.        So again if we take Role 2 Scenarios we come up with:        &nbsp;         Scenario1:    This person has more knowledge and less useful contribution.      Well it can be a bit irritating since he cannot help the new comers reframe the questions they are        trying to ask and can create a impression that this person is sitting with his ego pumped up.        So I think this scenario cannot &nbsp;be satisfactory.        &nbsp;        But let us take Scenario 2        &nbsp;         Scenario2:    The person who has more knowledge and less useless contribution can be       acceptable as the sentence says. So I think this scenario should be fine.        &nbsp;          ROLE 3 ANALYSIS:          &nbsp;        Ah, The Role 3 guy&#8230;seen many a times in corporate environments who is fresh in certain        Domain. He has less knowledge and less contribution. But this is not acceptable in corporate        world since this person should atleast know some basics of what is discussed about and should be        willing to learn.        &nbsp;        The scenarios again:         &nbsp;         Scenario 1:    The person has less knowledge and less useful contribution. He keeps on talking that      he knows everything and spills out less useful facts to the team. This is very very Dangerous        situation because the team members cannot discourage that what he talks is useless and that        he can waste the time of meeting by contributing things out of the subject because he gets a complex        and starts off suddenly just to show that he is the one rolling the ball.        &nbsp;        So watch out people&#8230;persons like this can be made to shift to one of the other acceptable quadrants.        &nbsp;         Scenario2:    This person has less knowledge and less useless contribution.      &nbsp;        Sounds fair..this guy is a new kid in the block and that he makes no mistakes while contributing or        asking doubts.        &nbsp;        So go for this scenario at any point of your life.        &nbsp;         ROLE 4 ANALYSIS:          &nbsp;         Less knowledge and more contribution. This seems fair if this guy contributes more usefully as in   Scenario1.          This person can bring his/her domain level expertise from a known domain to an unknown domain and finds        a correlation so that both parties who know his domain the best can share ideas and learn about unknown domains        Should be the ideal scenario when people of different roles meet and discuss.        &nbsp;        &nbsp;But this can be very harmful to the meeting if he is on   Scenario 2   &nbsp;that is he contributes more useless facts        and has less knowledge. Half Knowledge is dangerous.        &nbsp;        So to wrap up the discussion we have to be in one of the quadrants and in one of those role scenarios.        Let me sum up the good and bad role-scenarios:        &nbsp;          GOOD ROLES:          &nbsp;        &nbsp;        Role 1: Scenario 1:&nbsp; This person has more knowledge and more useful contribution.        Role 2: Scenario 2: &nbsp;This person has more knowledge and less useless contribution        Role 3: Scenario 2: &nbsp;This person has less knowledge and less useless contribution.        Role 4: Scenario 1: &nbsp;This person has less knowledge and more useful contribution        &nbsp;        And Watch Out for the other roles (  &#8220;NOT OK ROLES&#8221;  ) if not listed here, those are dangerous.        &nbsp;        So whenever we are in a meeting we can use the Knowledge vs. Contribution graph        and populate with the names of the meeting members. After that we must analyze        which scenario they belong to. And then you should be interacting more with the        GOOD Roles mentioned above and try to give feedback or help them if you have        categorized in the &#8220;NOT OK: Roles.        &nbsp;        So let us divert our topic and explore something else which comes out of my mind in my next blog.        &nbsp;        Seeya.

This is another true story of the values that revolves around football..Yes i like to watch movies that have strong values and it is all instilled in football movies except for the infamous Waterboy which is a crap show.  Remember the Titans, Replacement Players, ..follows the same line as this movie.   This story revolves around a passionate football coach who have started to train and move the town's team into victory and targeting the state finals....Radio, a slow and retarded youth who often pushed his trolley into the town and around the field where Coach Jones is training his boys..Coach befriended James which later is dubbed Radio, simply because James had a passion for radios, which he carries everywherer he goes. Coach Jones helps Radio by allowing him to help out in the football team and later when the season ends, he helps in the basketball team.in school... Through the  years, we get to see how Coach Jones develops a strong relationship with Radio and how Coach Jones fought for him and helped him... The true spirit of discipling is often seen here and Radio exhibits a very kind and forgiving heart that treats everybody the same no matter what they do to him.

       " \"                                     'Gaudet Mater Ecclesia!'   'Mother Church rejoices,' were the first words spoken by Pope John XXIII, at St. Peter's Basilica, on October 11, 1962, the opening day of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council.  'Come, Creator Spirit,' sang out two and a half thousand bishops.  This was a council unlike any other in history.  It had been 92 years since Vatican I and no one was expecting another such meeting.  Pope John was recently elected as Holy Pontiff and felt compelled by the Holy Spirit to call a council, though many were opposed to this.  When at last he was certain this was the prompting of the Holy Spirit, he initiated a council that changed and brought renewal to the Church in the modern world, without losing any part of Her very essence (doctrine).    Vatican II was the first council that was created, without the intention of stating doctrines condemning heresy.  This was a pastoral council, as Pope John felt that what the modern world needed was not condemnation for errors, but rather mercy and love.  As the world changed, the people changed.  Therefore, it is illogical to think that the Church would not also change with it.  The Church is One Body, One Ship, with people aiming for the same destination.  The key is to keep the same Truths, but to present them in a new way.  Over 1900 years, the Church had stayed traditional in its teaching and proclamation of the Gospel.  Pope John, inspired by the Spirit, saw that the modern world needed a new and vital way for the people to understand and better participate.  On example of change, was the lightening up of the structure of Liturgy, explained in the first conciliar document, Sacrosanctum Concilium.  Over the past 1900 years, minor things were tacked on to the Mass, which really were more ornamental than a necessary element.  Some examples are highly ornate garments, the pipe organ, and certain readings/prayers (all of which we could take out and still not detract from the dignity of the Mass).  The Church is the Bride of Christ and therefore the Holy Mother of us, her children.  Therefore, Mother Church desires that all of humanity be united in Her.  The Church, which is the Body of Christ, is a vine, and we the people are the branches, as Jesus said.  The Church spreads its branches over the whole earth, embracing every human with the grace to know and love God (the ability to reach heaven).  Vatican II wanted work harder towards this unity.  All people, as children of God should be united in peace.  There must be unity between all Catholics, because the Body is made up of 'connected' parts.  It is the Church's strong desire that all Christian and non-Christian religions be united to the One, True, Catholic Church, which Jesus established on earth to last throughout eternity.  One vital fact we must remember is that everything Vatican II hoped to accomplish could not be consummated immediately.  It takes time; perhaps until the end of time.  This is seen most clearly with the strife for unity.  Many millions of souls converted because of the effects of Vatican II.  However, many left the Church because of ignorance or disagreement.  There are many people, especially of the older generations who donÂ\\x92t understand exactly what Vatican II did.  They saw changes happening, which they blamed the Council on without even reading the conciliar documents for themselves.    An example of a major change was the Mass of the Traditional Latin Rite.  The Ordo Missae was the first book of the reformed liturgy.  This was a more simplified liturgy, which people could more easily participate in, with the changes addressed in the Sacrosanctum Concilium.  The language of the Mass was could be changed to that of the region, instead of Latin, based on the bishop's discretion.  These adjustments did not at all detract from the heart of the Mass, but helped more people to understand and participate in the Holy Sacrifice.   The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council did so much to help the world.  This paper can only show a glimpse of the copious fruits that came from the Holy Spirit through Vatican II.  This council lasted for four sessions, ending on December 8, 1965.  Pope John XXIII had died of cancer shortly after the first session, but Pope Paul VI finished what was started with the grace of the Holy Spirit as his Guide.   An English historian named Eamon Duffy called the Council of Vatican II, 'the most revolutionary Christian event since the Reformation.'  This truly was the consequence of the bravery and perseverance of two great popes, and above all a loving God.  At last the children of the Church could open a window and let in some fresh air.                        'Gaudet Mater Ecclesia!'           \",\n",

       " '                                     Autobiography    By Eric Heppner   The air was far too cold for it was a late march blizzard outside. The confining blanket of blue was not the same for it was not alive, it felt abrasive and rough compared warm softness from which I had just come. All twenty-two inches of my body shivered slightly from shock. My journey had been difficult to Fergus Falls, Minnesota, maybe because I had tried to take too much with me. Ten pounds and three ounces is a lot of baggage. My face was bruised something awful, my mother had always called me a prizefighter for that. I recognized a few of the voices surrounding me though I saw little besides soft white light and shades. I noticed one shade in particular. His voice was deep and frightening yet familiar and warm. I heard my name called out in song, I knew it because I had heard it all my life, Eric Ole Heppner. The shade spoke as if he didn’t expect me to be there to receive it. I heard singing for the first time. It was praise, praise to God that I had been born. I did not know this. When the tremendous shade held me in his arms, as a reaction, my body, without my consent, released my stored waste upon him. This only dampened his mood for a second as his strong arms held me all the closer. His name was Steven.  I learned from a far a more familiar voice that called me away from his arms. Her name was Joan. I had heard it many times throughout my journey yet her voice was my voice, her breath mine, and her love was mine. She held me gently to her breast and I could hear her heart, the heart that I had heard for nine months. That moment on March 27, 1987 was the greatest moment of my life.  My older brother Jon had spoken for me for the first year or so of my life. This made life very simple. I ate when he did, slept when he did, and got changed when he did. But I never had a first word. I had a first phrase. “I read a book.” What I wanted was for my parents to read to me. This was my first individual want, and I am glad that it was dedicated to a search for knowledge. My first actual word then would be “I” and for the life of speaking afterward, I would be trying to explain that word to others. Even though I was now speaking for my self, Jon was still wanting for the both of us. We did everything together. Early in the morning Jon would climb into my crib and when I had more wants I would say to him “Jonston leave me alone!” as I couldn’t pronounce Jonathan. This would never abate him and I would soon be awake and on an adventure whether it was eating various berries outside or flying imaginary planes made out of large cardboard blocks in the living room.  There was no limit to my imagination and Jon’s thirst to never sit still.  One particularly large adventure came when we found the special advantage that men have over women. We found that we unlike women could pee any place and at any time we desired. This magnificent freedom sent us on a quest to water every plant outside our Staten Island, New York parsonage. We built a small following in this venture and our best friends from church, Marcos and Luis, would ease the burden of our quest and passion. Yet with this help there came a terrible cost and her name was Maria. She was old yet I can never remember her getting any older, and she was little. She had had six boys and a girl; seven children in all and I remember thinking that each one of them must have taken a piece of her to make because there wasn’t much altitude left. Yet this had been attributed to her as her greatest weapon against our small band and our free ways for the closer she was to the ground the closer she was to her sandal. She wore leather sandals with everything, and it only lay at the most two feet from her hand that must have been made of wind. On one of our front lawn escapades, Maria caught us giving fluid to desperate shrubbery in the flowerbed. There she stood, all four feet of her magnificent power ready. As one can recall in the midst of great danger the motions of something so fast that it is uncaught by the natural eye.  I shall recall her motion. She flipped the leather weapon off her foot into the naked air in front of her and leaped forward. The sandal spun twice in the air and Maria caught the heel in her hand. She relinquished a scream that froze us dead to our very souls even if we had had time to go anywhere. I saw the face of Marcos get slapped and pushed out of the way as it headed like an arrow for its next target plowing Jon’s face back wards as he fell into the flowerbed. Louis next received the punishment and I saw saliva rocketed from his mouth as contact was made. I watched with terror unfelt in my young mind as with a helpless stare I saw the sandal close in inevitably on my tender jaw. The contact didn’t hurt at first yet surprised me as my slow motion vision had ended and those long mille-seconds ended as I spiraled through the air into the flowerbed in an instant. The pain rushed to my cheek as if I had no skin, muscle, or tissue of any kind left and the pain was simply flowing out onto the ground to create the next flood that would destroy the world. Luckily my cheek was still there. The shock of this left me dry for several days and nearly ended my infamous peeing crusade. Yet I have been notorious for not knowing when I have been vanquished.  It had only been a month after the Maria incident and I peed alone. Groups where to conspicuous. On occasion Jon would help but I didn’t feel safe with anyone else anymore. My legs were crossed when Marcos and Louis came. On this day I felt the irrepressible urge to water the honeysuckles that traipsed the fence of our yard. I stood on a solid fort built by my father to house Jon’s and my adventures. On this second story hideout I did the dastardly deed again. My golden arch reaching the honeysuckles, the fence, and the sidewalk. This was my error. Luckily I did not make the apocalyptic error of hitting a passerby in NYC with anything more liquid and warm then a sideways glance, and even that was dangerous. My ramifications for my sin came from across the street. Gwenn, one of my dad’s parishioners, happened to see my pernicious deed and I had barely gotten my fly back up when my mother, ear fresh from the phone, brought swift ramifications upon my backside and ears. Thus ended my illustrious urinating career and routed the last urination threat left in the community. I was to reform and forever after have been forced to use the head.                ',\n",

       " \"                                     Can anyone tell me why I even buy an anti-virus program?        &nbsp;        What do they do? Let's break it down.        &nbsp;        An antivirus program, such as Norton or McAffee, searches a users computer for things such as viruses, trojans, and worms. Every couple of hours it checks the Internet to see if there are any updates available. If there are, it downloads them and rescans the computer.        &nbsp;        While this makes since to most people, I truly don't understand. Is it not the Operating system writer that leaves the hole for a virus to come through? Why do we continue to see products like Mac OSX, Linux kernel 2.XX.X, Windows XP or Longhorn? Shouldn't we finish a product before we move on to the next level. Shouldn't an Operating System by 'hacker proof' or 'complete' before they move on to the next OS.        &nbsp;        Windows 98.        &nbsp;        Yes, the old faithful, Windows 98. While it had its share of problems and quirks, it was a leap ahead of ME, 2000, and XP in regards to security. Maleware writers had a much harder time writing viruses with this OS.         &nbsp;        The Big Question is; why did Microsoft even move beyond this OS when even it, while in our eyes is perfect, still held many errors and holes. Didn't Microsoft think to figure out how to fix these holes and making it more 'hacker proof' before bringing out completely new code in a new OS..         &nbsp;        Hmm, I think I see something        &nbsp;        Mac OS9 - OSX        &nbsp;        While Mac OS 9 and OS X may not be the main stream OS, it certainly is a popular one with the graphics and medical professions. This Operating System almost seems completely out of reach of Maleware writers, I believe it doesn't get attacked like windows only because of a lack of interest in the OS as a whole and therefore not complete as a 'hacker proof' OS.        &nbsp;        The Big Question is; I have a really hard time saying anything bad about Mac's OS's but with the recent release of security bugs found in OS X and up, one has to wonder whether Apple has their stuff together every time they upgrade their OS or if its just low usage of the OS that keeps it safe from attack.        &nbsp;        Linux/Unix        &nbsp;        While Unix is used in so many different industries, it tends to only be subject to direct attacks against certain companies. Why? We're not sure. Could be because if a person who knows Unix well enough to write a virus for it, usually is getting paid to maintain it.        &nbsp;        Now on the other hand is Linux. Linux is riddled with security holes.         &nbsp;        So what makes it different? Open Source does.        &nbsp;        With any Operating System, two things happen at the same time when a security hole is found. (1) Maleware writers quickly take advantage of the hole with viruses because the Company owning rights to the OS doesn't want or accept any advice or allow anyone to see the code and present possible solutions.. (2) The OS creator/company puts out a patch 30-90 days after the discovery of the hole, depending wholly on the Anti-Virus companies to protect the user until the correct answer can be found. But with Linux, when a new security whole is found, again two things happen but at different times. (1) Maleware writers and programmers put their heads together and find a solution to the problem and then submit it to the Linux Community. (2) the Linux community releases an updated kernel/Patch as quickly as possible.        &nbsp;        The Big Question is: Is it because of Open Source that Linux/Unix doesn't need anti-virus programs? No, not wholly, but close. It is the simple facts that as a computer programmer looking to do something with his mind, he can simply find a hole and fix it. With any other OS, the only thing a programmer can do is write a virus because he has no access to the source code and henceforth cant fix the problem.        &nbsp;        &nbsp;        What's the answer to the Anti-Virus cycle? Open source? No, we don't think so. But how about just finishing an Operating System before bringing it out and decreasing the need for Anti-Virus programs?     \",\n",

The fragment meme is done by taking 3 random Fragment sentences and incorporating a story around them. The fragments are in bold.    I'm doing something a little different with this fragment.  I'm working on a larger story, and this is one small scene from that story.  I'm just trying to feel out the characters and figure out where I want it to go.   The life he knew was over.  It was tough to wrap the words around the thought  in his mind .  That all he had known and loved for the last 7 years was gone.  Friends, love, routine.. comfort.  But he was here because he was needed.  He stares out the window watching people walk past his parked car and he leans back in his seat.  His hand rests on the steering wheel as a song finishes playing on the radio.  The song plays in the background of his mind as he ponders the unknown path that lay before him.  His mother was dying, his father was distant and over-worked.  Nothing was right.  Nothing was the same.  He did what any loving son would do in this situation, he dropped his life on the coast and came home.  Despite it being the home he had never really known.    Suddenly he realizes that the song has stopped and a commercial blares disturbing him from thought.  He leaves the car and enters a small cafe on the corner of a busy street.   It's a beautiful  little shop, with bright vibrant colors.  It stands out against the dirt and rust that dominates this town.  He'd been coming here every few days since he first came to town 3 weeks ago.  He doesn't even like the coffee.  But the first day he came to town he came here to get away from the stress at the house.  And the girl working behind the counter gave him the sweetest smile.  It almost made him forget about his troubles.  So he finds himself coming back just to see her smile.  The things we do to escape what saddens us.  He never talks to her, just enjoys the smile.  Maybe one day he will tell her what it means to him.  But not now.  He doesn't want  her  thinking about it any more than  he  wants to be thinking about it.  He sits by the window and sips the coffee.  He wonders if after a few more weeks he would  no longer notice  the awful taste.  Suddenly he finds himself smiling into his cup.  Finding amusement in realzing that most things in his life these days are bittersweet.   --Will                     \",\n",

They keep me as busy as a soccer mom.        &#8212;Brenda Mejia, &quot;Pet stories,&quot; The Desert Sun (    Palm Springs    ,     CA    ),     April 30, 2004             &nbsp;        &nbsp;         Notes:         The code of politically correct speech has come down against the word pet, which at first blush seems about as inoffensive a term as there is in the language. It has referred to a domesticated or tamed animal since the 16th century, and has even branched out to mean a favorite person, or one who is treated with special kindness. What's wrong with that? Plenty, say the animal-rights activists. Pet implies the human ownership of an animal, and that just won't do. The preferred term now is companion animal (1977).         &nbsp;        The term furkid, of course, takes us beyond the treatment of the animal as a mere companion and into the realm of surrogate kid-hood. Now we animal guardians (1997) can apply our hyper-parenting skills to our dogs, cats, and other four-legged members of the family.         &nbsp;        That some of us are doing this is further evidenced by the fact that a number of synonyms for furkid exist, including furbaby (1993; also: fur baby) and furchild (2000; also: fur child).         &nbsp;        Example Citation #2:         Most everything I ever needed to learn about babies I learned from my dogs.         &nbsp;        Although I never went as far as calling them my &quot;fur kids,&quot; dogs long predated babies in my life. Indeed, in other pages of this newspaper, I am a pets columnist, writing about everything from bearded dragons to border collies. But as I begin to compose the occasional mothering column as well, I've discovered that there's plenty of crossover wisdom between species.        &#8212;Denise Flaim, &quot;Triplet Chronicles; Dogged lessons in baby care,&quot; Newsday,     May 17,  2004             &nbsp;        The ch    allen    ge for all of you is to use &#8220;furkid&#8221;&nbsp; in a sentence as many times as you possible can.&nbsp;        &nbsp;        My extension on furkid is &#8220;furniece&#8221;.&nbsp; That is my sister has a furkid, therefore I have a furniece.        &nbsp;        End of Rant      \",\n",

       " '                                     I think that the glory of God’s creation is so often thought to be mainly its beauty, but I’ve been realizing that merely the originality of God’s creation is wondrous, and filled with His glory.                      We, as humans, tend to judge heavenly things by our own earthly experience, which is foolish. God is the center of the universe; he is its Creator, and the Master of all things. He is not only one who knows all things, but he is the Creator of all things. He is perfectly righteous, and our entire purpose is to give glory to the Being who created us. Not only did he create us, but loved us, and in his love, sent his Son to die for our sins, that we might be covered with his perfect righteousness, and live eternally with him. In light of all he is and all he’s done for us, should we not judge what we see by his standards revealed to us, rather than our own petty, corrupted, earthly experience?                      What does this have to do with God’s creation? Well, what we first see is the beauty of creation, and in it, we see its Creator. Psalm 19:1 says, “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above his handiwork.” In the first chapter of Romans, Paul writes, “For what can be known about God is plain to them because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.” But in creation, if you think about it, the thing that will strike you with the glory of the Creator is not only its beauty, but its originality. God is the Master Artist and Inventor. He not only paints beautifully, but he paints, not a copy of anything, not even something which is inspired by something else, something that is totally original. Out of absolute darkness and blackness, the earth was formed, and the sky above it.                      This, perhaps, doesn’t sound so wondrous. But think of it this way: try to create an animal, and don’t copy any of the animals that you’ve seen or even heard of. Don’t use feathers, wings, tails, scales, etc. Don’t even let yourself get ideas from other animals. So, what happened? I tried this for a while and couldn’t come up with anything without coping features of animals which already existed. Now think of this: God created animals when there were no other animals to copy or be inspired by. In fact, he created even the idea of an animal. Quite an imagination, don’t you agree?                      God not only creates totally original things, but he makes all of his creation work perfectly. I don’t mean that our world is perfect, that is, it was before the fall of man, just that it works fit together perfectly. Think of the rising and setting of the sun, think of the seasons, and gravity. In Genesis 8:22 the Lord says, “While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.” God created all of these things and forces. I was sitting in my backyard reading, and I looked randomly at a blade of grass. As I looked, I thought, “You know there really isn’t a lot of beauty in one strand of grass. There is in a field of grass, but one single strand doesn’t seem like such a big deal.” Then I asked myself what the purpose of grass was. In science this year we learned that without grass, the soil under it would wash away when it rained. Grass holds the soil and dirt together, so to speak. Not only does the grass perfectly serve its purpose, but it does it with a beauty that gives such a tribute to its Creator. A grassy field with sunlight streaming on it, glistening on the morning dew, and wind making it ripple like water, is a pleasant thing to look at. No, maybe one strand of grass isn’t such a big deal, but I know I never would have been able to create it myself, let alone create it out of nothing, from nothing, with nothing, and with no original idea from which to branch off.                      When I think about this I just feel so much the creative power of our God. How awesome are his works! How wonderful it is to be one of his creations and give him glory! It certainly is good.

Then on the way to the market I learned that my drawing desk apparently has suicidal tendancies, for he lept from my truck and barreled into oncoming traffic.  It did something similar yesterday.  I know you're thinking 'Well why doesn't the dumbass tie it down or something?!'  Well screw you for thinking that, because I  did  tie it down, and that's why it dragged behind me a good 10 - 20 feet.  My desk hates itself.  Sigh.  It turns out it's not that bad, the wheels are all broken, but I never liked them anyways, and the table top only fastens on one side, and it keeps flopping around any time I touch it.  So I should fix that.    So after I get to the market and get everything set up and sit down I realize, 'It's fucking cold today!'

So, if we do remember an event then maybe some of our random thoughts could have happened also.           &nbsp;          Something to cogitate.      ',\n",

       " '                                    Nede    By Eric Heppner   There was light in existence for the first time. The translucent brilliance of the womb, tried my new eyes. There was motion as well. Motion and light enveloped me. Then finally, there was pain, pain beyond thought, pain that preceded the darkness. I awoke from the darkness into a light that did not hurt my eyes. Stepping forward by instinct, I felt my own form. It was bigger than I had though, or remembered. I could see, smell, and distinguish touch. What I saw I understood as naturally as a lifetime of familiarity. The solid trees, soft soil, and ever-moving water were familiar and beautiful to me. I wandered in the world, without pain. My mind gave me strange visions of a life I had never had. The people of the city were all like me. They all wandered in and out of the different houses that belonged to no one. There was all manner of food that appeared without work on long tables. Yet, there was no desire to eat it, for there was no hunger in the city. People slept in large soft beds, despite not being tired. No weary pulled on the people’s eyes. No blissful ache invaded the muscle, no matter the toil or strain, of which there was none. The perfect city’s name was Nede. The people of Nede, like me, all knew the lives they would have had, if they had not come here. Some would smile, when they first saw the life of hardships that they had bee spared. All though, eventually turned sullen as they saw what could have been, the choices left unmade, and things left unchanged. I know nine musicians, whose lives would have created beauty on the Earth, where there was none before. There are athletes who have never known the heights of victory and the resilience of defeat. I see innumerable lovers who will never know a living relationship, the warmth of a lover’s embrace, or the trust and fulfillment that comes from a lover’s silence. I have the friendship of a woman who would have been a great healer. She would have cured the plague of cancer from the world. Now she sits under the trees. Unable to save the lives of the people she has never been able to meet.  I am often asked, around the dinner table, what would have become of my life, had I lived. I would have been simply a teacher. I would have been great to a few. I would have had a wife and two children. Though now, I have nothing. I never made it past birth.               ',\n",

George McClelland,  urlLink mailto:webmaster@www.wealthwit.com  ************************************************************ ------------------------------------------------------------  Is Your Program Right For You? by Kellie Marzolf © 2004   Before you become involved in any program, the most  important thing you can do is research.  Learn and think  about the product.  Is it something you could benefit from  personally?  Could you see yourself recommending it to a  friend or family member?  Do your homework and find out as much about the program and  the people that run it as you can.  Get a feel for the  operation and see if it will be a good fit.  You want to  find out exactly what you'll be becoming a part of as this  will save you some time and discouragement in the future.  As you pick your program, you need to be aware that in order  to expect to make any profit, the product or service needs to  be one that appeals to a lot of people.  It has to be one that  you feel confident putting your name on.  Your name is your  reputation and you have every right to be picky.  Does this program provide you with sales material and  training support? If your sponsor is not active in training  you, do they offer the option of being placed with another  one?  It will ultimately be your decision how much time and  effort you're going to spend developing yourself and your  program, but does the program offer the tools to help you  succeed?  Make sure the program is everything they tell you it is.   Many people are charmed into signing up for something and  then being left to wonder what to do next.  They aren't  trained on how to sell, who to sell to and the fact that  their payoff is related to their participation.  You will more than likely have people signup and expect  financial miracles; incomes without the effort.  They'll  hang around for two or three months and then jump to the  next hot program to come out.  These are known as 'MLM  Junkies', always wondering why they can't succeed in making  their fortune.  Are you one of these people?  I hope that you're one of the  smart marketers that understands that you need to work one  program, stick with it for at least a good solid year or  until you start seeing positive results before you take on  a new program.  Jumping programs and adding are two different  things.  Those who jump will rarely accomplish anything but a  depleted bank account.  Those who add with patience and  persistence will eventually accumulate several multiple  streams of income that could very well lead to the life  they aspire to have.  So, what are you?  I hope you won't be a jumper.  It will  take time and effort but the rewards will far outweigh the  work.  ====================================================  Join GFTGD Newsletter!

Tell them they can pay for your product or service with easy monthly payments. For example, you could say, 'You Can Own Our Product With 3 Easy Payments Of ($)!' Another idea would be to eliminate one of those payments later on in your ad copy.   2) Give your prospects extra confidence so they will order.  Use endorsements, testimonials, a strong guarantee or warranty, etc. For example, you could say, 'I'm going to allow you to try out our product for a full 60 days without billing your card!'   3) End your sales letter or ad copy with a strong closing.  It could be a free bonus, a discount price, a benefit reminder, an ordering deadline, etc. For example, you could say, 'P.S. Remember, you'll get 5 bonuses valued at $245!' Another example would be, 'P.S.

       " \"                                    Overview of Native XML Web Services for Microsoft SQL Server 2005                                                             Introduction   Microsoft® SQL Server™ 2005 provides a standard mechanism for accessing the database engine using SOAP via HTTP. Using this mechanism, you can send SOAP/HTTP requests to SQL Server to execute:      Transact-SQL batch statements, with or without parameters.   Stored procedures, extended stored procedures, and scalar-valued user-defined functions.     Prior to SQL Server 2005, the only mechanism available to connect to SQL Server was through a custom binary protocol named Tabular Data Stream (TDS). With SOAP/HTTP access, we have provided an open and documented protocol that may be used as an alternative to connect to SQL Server. Providing SOAP/HTTP access enables a broader range of clients to access SQL Server, including 'zero foot print' clients, because there is no longer a need to have a Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) stack installed on the client device trying to connect to SQL Server. It facilitates interoperability with .NET, SOAP Toolkit, Perl, and more on a variety of platforms. Since the SOAP/HTTP access mechanism is based on well-known technologies such as XML and HTTP, it inherently promotes interoperability and access to SQL Server in a heterogeneous environment. Any device that can parse XML and submit HTTP requests can now access SQL Server.    Many enterprises have heterogeneous environments in which applications that run on UNIX and Linux platforms might require connectivity to SQL Server. Traditionally, the only solution available to such users was to use either JDBC or ODBC drivers. The SOAP/HTTP access now provides another, low-cost alternative. It is extremely useful for scenarios where DBA's have scripts written in Perl that run on UNIX and manage a SQL Server resource. It is also useful in developing client applications that connect to SQL Server using smart integrated development environments (IDEs) that have built-in SOAP/HTTP support, such as Microsoft Visual Studio® .NET or Jbuilder. These IDEs generate proxy code that abstracts the communication with SQL Server and provides objects that the client applications can use. Using SOAP/HTTP also enables anytime, anywhere access to SQL Server, which makes it easier to develop applications for mobile or sporadically connected devices. Once a connection has been  established and the server has started processing requests, it can be monitored using existing mechanisms that TDS-based clients such as sqlclient, ODBC, and OLEDB use.       Requirements   SQL Server 2005–native Web services require Microsoft Windows Server™ 2003 as the operating system, because they rely on the kernel mode http driver http.sys that this version provides. Since SQL Server leverages the kernel mode http.sys driver, you do not necessarily need to have IIS installed to expose Web services out of SQL Server; this simplifies administration. Instead, you should base your decision to install IIS on application requirements. For example, certain applications benefit from having an explicit middle tier. In such cases, IIS would be useful.     HTTP Endpoints   Setting up SQL Server as a Web Service that can listen natively for HTTP SOAP requests requires creating an HTTP endpoint and defining the methods that the endpoint exposes. When an HTTP endpoint is created, it must be created with a unique URL that it uses to listen for incoming HTTP requests. For example, if you create an endpoint with the URL 'http://servername/sql,' SOAP requests that are sent to http://servername/sql will be picked up by http.sys. Http.sys will then route the SOAP requests to the SQL Server instance that hosts the endpoint associated with the URL. From there, the requests will be handed off to the SOAP processing layer within SQL Server.    A SQL Server instance can have multiple endpoints, each of which can expose any number of stored procedures (implemented using either Transact-SQL or CLR) as WebMethods on the endpoint and can be invoked via SOAP remote procedure calls (RPCs). A WebMethod can have a different name than the actual stored procedure that is being exposed. The WebMethod name is what is shown to the user in WSDL as the operation name.     Note &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to call out that the WebMethod clause in the endpoint is specific to SQL Server 2005 and is unrelated to the ASMX WebMethod attribute.   Users have the ability to execute ad-hoc Transact-SQL statements against the endpoints. This is done by enabling batches on the endpoint using an optional clause in the data definition language (DDL). Enabling batches implicitly results in a WebMethod named 'sqlbatch' being exposed to the user. These concepts are illustrated further in the next few sections.       CREATE HTTP ENDPOINT   HTTP Endpoints are created and administered using Transact-SQL DDL. Creating an HTTP Endpoint is the first step in enabling HTTP/SOAP access to SQL Server 2005. Each endpoint has a name and a collection of options that when combined define the behavior of the endpoint.   To illustrate how the CREATE HTTP ENDPOINT is used, let's take a look at a Hello World example for invoking a stored procedure via SQL Server Web Services.    First, create a stored procedure called hello world in the master database, using the following T-SQL. This stored procedure simply displays the string provided in the input parameter.  CREATE PROCEDURE hello_world (@msg nvarchar(256)) AS BEGIN    select @msg as 'message' END     Next, use the following T-SQL to create the HTTP endpoint which will allow access to this stored procedure as a WebMethod:  CREATE HTTP ENDPOINT hello_world_endpoint   AS     AUTHENTICATON = ( INTEGRATED ),     PATH = '/sql/demo',     PORTS = ( CLEAR ),     STATE = STARTED FOR SOAP (   METHOD     'http://tempuri.org/'.'hello_world'      (NAME = master.dbo.hello_world)   WITH     BATCHES = ENABLED,     WSDL = DEFAULT   )     All endpoints are stored in master, in the metadata view master.sys.http_endpoints. An endpoint doesn't have any SOAP Methods unless you define them. In the above example, we exposed the stored procedure master.dbo.hello_world as WebMethod 'hello_world'; the WebMethod can have any name and, for example, could have been called as 'testproc1' under the 'http://tempuri.org' namespace. Specifying DEFAULT as the value for WSDL clause enables the endpoint to respond to requests for WSDL generating WSDL using the default format. You can suppress WSDL generation by setting WSDL=NONE in the above statement. We discuss the details of WSDL generation in a subsequent section.       Authentication and Security   HTTP Endpoints support the following standard authentication mechanisms: Basic, Digest, Integrated (NTLM, Kerberos), Anonymous - SQL Auth. You first authenticate at the HTTP transport level. Once that is successful, the users SID is used to authenticate with SQL. This is true for all options except ANONYMOUS. Specifying ANONYMOUS at the endpoint only implies that it is anonymous at the HTTP transport level, the client will still need to provide SQL Auth credentials in order to be able to authenticate with the database. When ANONYMOUS is specified an additional HTTP header is required that encodes user name and password. The header must be called 'MS-SQLAuth' and the value must be the base64 encoding of a valid username:password. Administrators can also set IP based Restrictions on an endpoint basis, restricting access to endpoints by only allowing specified IP's or ranges of IP's access to HTTP endpoints. Conceptually, an 'endpoint' is an 'application'—all the methods that  implement a single application are mapped to an endpoint, and so security is applied to the endpoint to control access to the application. Endpoints are secure by design; listed below are a few items that help make endpoints secure.      Off by default. No default endpoints or Web methods mapped; must be explicitly created and specified.   Security checks also apply to objects, so a mapped stored procedure is only executable if the user has connect permissions on the endpoint, plus execute permissions on the stored procedure.   No anonymous support for connecting to endpoints. All requests, including requests for WSDL are authenticated. Clients must authenticate, against SQL Server principles, in order to submit any request.     When an endpoint is created, only members of the sysadmin role and the owner of the endpoint can connect to the endpoint. You must grant connect permission for users to access your endpoint; this is accomplished by executing the following statement:  GRANT CONNECT ON HTTP ENDPOINT::hello_world_endpoint TO [DOMAIN\\\\USER]     Clients on non-Microsoft platforms can connect to SQL Server by using either BASIC or SQL Auth. However, using BASIC or SQL Auth requires the channel to be secure, so users can connect only on ports that also have SSL enabled.     WSDL   WSDL is a document written in XML that describes a Web service. It specifies the location of the service and the operations (or methods) the service exposes. WSDL provides the information necessary for a client to interact with a Web service. Tools such as Visual Studio .NET and Jbuilder use the WSDL to generate proxy code that client applications can use to communicate with a Web service. If the endpoint has WSDL enabled, that endpoint will produce WSDL when it receives a request for it. The endpoint created earlier in this article will produce WSDL when an authenticated request is sent to it. A WSDL request is a simple HTTP get request of the form.  http://servername/sql/demo?wsdl    The server queries the metadata associated with the endpoint and generates the WSDL dynamically. The WSDL generated provides rich type description of the parameters of the stored procedure. The server has the ability to generate different flavors of WSDL—we call it simple and complex WSDL, depending on whether we use primitive xsd types or complex types to describe the parameters in a request/response message. The default is to use complex types.       SOAP RPC: Method Invocation   In the endpoint created above we have exposed this stored procedure master.dbo.hello_world as a Web method that we can execute via SOAP RPC. The following is an example of the soap message that is sent to the server to invoke this SP via SOAP over HTTP.  &lt;SOAP-ENV:Envelope    xmlns:SOAP-ENV='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/'&gt;    &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt;       &lt;hello_world xmlns='http://tempuri.org/'&gt;           &lt;msg&gt;Hello World!&lt;/msg&gt;        &lt;/hello_world&gt;    &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Body&gt; &lt;/SOAP-ENV:Envelope&gt;    The result will be a SOAP envelope containing:  &lt;SqlRowSet1 xmlns='urn:schemas-microsoft-com:sql:SqlRowSet1'&gt;   &lt;row&gt;     &lt;message&gt;Hello World!&lt;/message&gt;   &lt;/row&gt; &lt;/SqlRowSet1&gt;        Batches: AdHoc Queries   When BATCHES are ENABLED on an endpoint by using the T-SQL command, another SOAP method, called 'sqlbatch,' is implicitly exposed on the endpoint. The sqlbatch method allows you to execute T-SQL statements via SOAP. This method takes two parameters. The first parameter is named '&lt;BatchCommands&gt;' and is the batch of T-SQL statements. The second parameter is named '&lt;Parameters&gt;' and is optional; it contains an array of parameter information if the T-SQL statement used any parameters. For example, here is the body of the SOAP request that calls the sqlbatch method and executes a parameterized query.  &lt;sqlbatch xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQLServer/2001/12/SOAP'&gt;   &lt;BatchCommands&gt;      SELECT EmployeeID, LoginID, Gender     FROM Employee     WHERE EmployeeID=@x     FOR XML AUTO;   &lt;/BatchCommands&gt;   &lt;Parameters&gt;     &lt;SqlParameter name='x' sqlDbType='Int' maxLength='20'    xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/SQLServer/2001/12/SOAP/types/SqlParameter'&gt;       &lt;Value xsi:type='xsd:string'&gt;1&lt;/Value&gt;     &lt;/SqlParameter&gt;   &lt;/Parameters&gt; &lt;/sqlbatch&gt;     The response from this SOAP request will contain the following:  &lt;sqlresultstream:SqlXml xsi:type='sqlsoaptypes:SqlXml'&gt;   &lt;SqlXml&gt;     &lt;employees EmployeeID='1' FirstName='Nancy' LastName='Davolio'/&gt;                           &lt;/SqlXml&gt; &lt;/sqlresultstream:SqlXml&gt;        Administration and Management   We have seen how simple it is to create an endpoint and submit SOAP requests against the endpoint. Administration is simplified because we now have to administer only one component, namely SQL Server. We don't need to administer an IIS component. The endpoint abstraction provides greater flexibility to administrators, who can enable IP filtering. It also eliminates the need to open up another port because we reuse the port used for http/https Web traffic. You can also provision endpoints for access by only certain individuals by explicitly granting CONNECT privileges only to those users.       Conclusion   With native SOAP access we have provided a protocol based on well-known and documented standards such as SOAP/HTTP to access SQL Server. This promotes interoperability and facilitates outreach by enabling a broader range of clients to connect to SQL Server.     Collected By     Rajjan                         \",\n",
       " \"                                    SUBJECT: TALKING MEAT     A dialogue by Terry Bisson.  From a series of stories entitled         'Alien/Nation' in the April [1991?] issue of _Omni_.  'They're made out of meat.'  'Meat?'  'Meat. They're made out of meat.'  'Meat?'  'There's no doubt about it.  We picked several from different parts  of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all  the way through.  They're completely meat.'  'That's impossible.  What about the radio signals?  The messages to  the stars?'  'They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from  them.  The signals come from machines.'  'So who made the machines?  That's who we want to contact.'  'They made the machines.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  Meat  made the machines.'  'That's ridiculous.  How can meat make a machine?  You're asking me  to believe in sentient meat.'  'I'm not asking you, I 'm telling you.  These creatures are the only  sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat.'  'Maybe they're like the Orfolei.  You know, a carbon-based  intelligence that goes through a meat stage.'  'Nope. They're born meat and they die meat.  We studied them for  several of their life spans, which didn't take too long.  Do you  have any idea the life span of meat?'  'Spare me.  Okay, maybe they're only part meat.  You know, like the  Weddilei.  A meat head with an electron plamsa brain inside.'  'Nope.  We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the  Weddilei.  But I told you, we probed them.  They're meat all the  way through.'  'No brain?'  'Oh, there is a brain all right.  It's just that the brain is made  out of meat!'  'So... what does the thinking?'  'You're not understanding, are you?  The brain does the thinking.  The meat.'  'Thinking meat!  You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!'  'Yes, thinking meat!  Conscious meat!  Loving meat.  Dreaming meat.  The meat is the whole deal!  Are you getting the picture?'  'Omigod.  You're serious then.  They're made out of meat.'  'Finally, Yes.  They are indeed made out meat.  And they've been  trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years.'  'So what does the meat have in mind.'  'First it wants to talk to us.  Then I imagine it wants to explore  the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information.  The usual.'  'We're supposed to talk to meat?'  'That's the idea.  That's the message they're sending out by radio.  'Hello.  Anyone out there?  Anyone home?' That sort of thing.'  'They actually do talk, then.  They use words, ideas, concepts?'  'Oh, yes.  Except they do it with meat.'  'I thought you just told me they used radio.'  'They do, but what do you think is on the radio?  Meat sounds.  You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise?  They  talk by flapping their meat at each other.  They can even sing by  squirting air through their meat.'  'Omigod.  Singing meat.  This is altogether too much.  So what do  you advise?'  'Officially or unofficially?'  'Both.'  'Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any  and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without  prejudice, fear, or favor.  Unofficially, I advise that we erase  the records and forget the whole thing.'  'I was hoping you would say that.'  'It seems harsh, but there is a limit.  Do we really want to make  contact with meat?'  'I agree one hundred percent.  What's there to say?' `Hello, meat.  How's it going?'  But will this work?  How many planets are we  dealing with here?'  'Just one.  They can travel to other planets in special meat  containers, but they can't live on them.  And being meat, they  only travel through C space.  Which limits them to the speed of  light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact  pretty slim.  Infinitesimal, in fact.'  'So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe.'  'That's it.'  'Cruel. But you said it yourself, who want to meet meat?  And the  ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed?  You're sure they won't remember?'  'They'll be considered crackpots if they do.  We went into their  heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to  them.'  'A dream to meat!  How strangely appropiate, that we should be  meat's dream.'  'And we can marked this sector unoccupied.'  'Good.  Agreed, officially and unofficially.  Case closed.  Any  others?  Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?'  'Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence  in a class nine star in G445 zone.  Was in contact two galactic  rotations ago, wants to be friendly again.'  'They always come around.'  'And why not?  Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the  universe would be if one were all alone.          \",\n",
       " \"                                    San Diego Comic-Con - Day TWO       So this is just a disclaimer. The next 4 or 5 posts may be a little boring. They're mostly my journal from the convention, lots of business observation and industry babble. So forgive the mundane nature for the next few days. But who knows.. maybe you're into that sort of thing.        THURSDAY     This year we took the train to the convention center each day. I was all about making this years trip as low stress as possible. And avoiding the Comic-Con's crazy-ass parking and traffic was high on my priorities. Interestingly enough, SD expanded their trolley system quite a bit in the last year. And there was a station at the mall about a mile from our hotel. So we each bought 5-day passes and used them to our full advantage. Very convenient. That and there's just something fun about riding a train every day.     So we each had stuff we wanted to do at the show. Jays' a big game design buff. He even went to the Arts Institute of Houston for a few years learning to do just that, as well as animation. So the comic-con was a great experience for him. It's funny that he and I went to our first real convention together back in high school. It was neat to share in this Con with him all these years later. So after wandering around together for a little while we split up. Adrienne and I spent most of the first day together while Jay went off to do his thing.     I started off with a 'networking' seminar. It turns out I'd been to it before, in fact I'd been to it at my very first Comic-Con and he was handing out the same (albeit useful) information as he was back then. But it was redundant for me, so I left, and ended up standing around in the hall outside the room talking with Adrienne. When suddenly someone comes running up to me asking me where the DC portfolio reviews were being held. As I was thumbing through the program book looking for the info he started showing me and Addy his portfolio. I couldn't resist, I started into a critique and started giving him some loose tutorials right there on the floor in the hall. It was funny. We actually started to draw a small crowd. Then as we're getting up to leave I suddenly realize that we were sitting in the exact same spot I got my first critique back in 97. Right there in the middle of the hallway sitting cross-legged with a small crowd gathering round. Full Circle.     Anyways, for me - there seemed to be a common theme running through the entire show. It started with the first panel of the day (that I actually stuck around) with  urlLink Stephen Silver . Silver is an animation designer. He does character designs for a lot of my favorite shows. Kim Possible being number one. He did all the character designs for the first two seasons. Anyways, somewhere around the middle of his panel he started talking about doing caricatures. It seemed to come out of the blue, but then it became a central theme. He said that doing caricatures, at parks, and malls and theme parks is what he attributes a strong part of his success to. And he kept emphasizing that everyone in the audience get into it as a career. Then he went into saying the same thing about life-drawing. The funny part is that some of it was verbatim what I had said to the artist in the hall. It's always interesting when you get reinforced that you seem to be on the right track.    Continuing with the Theme. Later on I found myself in front of the Watts Atelier booth asking some questions. Court Jones was the instructor that started asking me questions. Turns out he teaches Caricatures at the Atelier. And he spent the last few years working as a caricature artist at SeaWorld San Diego. He, like Silver, went on to say that Caricatures was one of the best things that ever happened to him artistically. He also mentioned what it was like doing caricatures at Sea World. They pretty much do it all for you, they give you the supplies, the tools, the training and they hold your hand and give you an enormous support group of other artists to bounce styles and skills off of. I was drooling at the thought of having, not just one other artist around to encourage me and challenge me to draw better, but 25. I kick my ass every week at the flea market to try and make a small living and teach myself these skills. And these guys have it handed to them in a neat little package, and where they can earn $250 a day in the summer. So the theme... as you can see... is that I'm definitely in the wrong place.     It seemed to repeat over and over all weekend. From the ShaneGlines Sketchbook group - full of professional animators I might add - meeting once a week at a coffee shop to just 'draw!' To the Atelier, full of working animators, game designers, conceptual artists and professional comic book artists 'already' working in the industry. Throw in sea world, where I'd be doing what I'm doing already, but getting real support (and money) for it. I am most definitely, unquestionably, irrefutibly... in the wrong place.     I've craved artistic camaraderie for years. I've done everything I can think of to make it work in Lubbock. I've tutored, published, apprenticed, networked, and supported every artist I've run across. Just in hopes of finding a handful of artists to compete, and grow with. And out of the hundred or so artists I've worked with over the last 8 years... well, I'm still alone. For whatever reason. Lubbock may be cheaper, and more convenient to live in than San Diego... but it sure as hell isn't worth what you have to give up. At least that's what I'm finally realizing.            --Will                                      \",\n",

       " '                                    Written by John W. J. Staub            &nbsp;          Before I begin this article, I would like to give anyone who reads this a bit of background info on me.      I am a 17 years old and have never kissed any girl. When I was 12, I made the commitment to God and myself, that I would completely save all forms of physical intimacy for my wife until my wedding day, including my first kiss. Now, I had no idea to the vastness of what I was committing to at that point. Over these past 5 years I have only by the grace of strength of God stayed true to these commitments. But as you read these next couple of paragraphs, I hope you will see that what I write I do not   only   write, but also live as a lifestyle. The questions I will present to you here are simple. Yet, steer away from their simplicity and you may find yourself in very deep philosophical waters. I do not wish to create theories or enforce rules. All I desire in this is that people think further than they have about this subject before, and that they open their minds to the possibilities of new ideas; ideas that   may   change your life.           &nbsp;          My first question is: What is a   kiss  ?      Is it simply when two pairs of lips meet? Is it when those same lips are brushed softly on a cheek? Or is it when two pairs of lips are pressed together, separated and the tongues collide and caress each other? I will not answer these questions as definite, but merely as my own personal conviction. My commitment is to keep my lips to myself entirely. I believe that I should not separate one kiss from another. A kiss is a kiss. Now, I do agree that when you are not   romantically   involved with someone, such as family members or those you feel as family, a kiss changes it&#8217;s emotional meaning. But it is still indeed a kiss. Then a second question arouses from the first:   What   is a kiss? Is it the showing of a strong loving affection of two friends? The outward display of an inward feeling? Or is it the acknowledgement of two lovers ready to unite and become one? I believe that all of the previous statements, dependant on the variables of each individual relationship. I don&#8217;t think anyone could (or should) kiss their mom or dad with the same emotional and physical intimacy they would with their husband or wife. This brings the idea to light that every kiss is different dependant on the moment that it is made. To me, there are just too many variables involved. Honestly, I wouldn&#8217;t want to trust myself to those ever-changing circumstances and the dangerous possibility of compromise. Why should I willingly put myself in circumstances that will tempt me?           &nbsp;          This brings me to my next thought.      I have long believed that sex is a complete act; from start to finish. I just recently came upon this article that properly displays my viewpoint. It may be a bit extreme, but sometimes you need extremity to produce productivity. John White writes:           &nbsp;         &#8220;Defining coitus in terms of penetration and orgasm has as much moral significance and as much logical difficulty as trying to define a beard by the number of hairs on a chin . . .&#8221;           &#8220;I know that experts used to distinguish light from heavy petting, and heavy petting from intercourse, but it there any moral difference between two naked people in bed petting to orgasm and another two having intercourse? Is the one act a fraction of an ounce less sinful than the other? Is it perhaps more righteous to pet with clothes on? If so, which is worse, to pet with clothes off or to have intercourse with clothes on?          You may accuse me of being crude. Far from it. If we continue the arguments far enough, we see that the morality of premarital sex that is based on the details of behavior (kissing, dressing, un-dressing, touching, holding, looking) and parts of the body (fingers, hair, arms, breast, lips, genitalia) can only satisfy a Pharisee. A look can be as sensual as a touch, and a finger brushed lightly over a cheek as erotic as penetration.&#8221;   - John White, Eros Defiled (Downers Grove, Ill.: Intervarsity Press, 1977), 53.             &nbsp;          This excerpt caused me great thought.      If indeed a look can be as sensual as a touch, have I ever looked any girls in that way? I pray that I haven&#8217;t and do not believe I have. But the reality of those simply stated three paragraphs have much theological depth to them. I completely believe with Mr. White in that sex is   much   more than just intercourse, it&#8217;s everything combined into one complete unit. It includes body-language, looking with the eyes and even the emotions. This is why I believe Jesus said, &#8220;. . .      anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart     .&#8221; If even the looking of the eyes is the beginning of sexual intimacy, then how can a kiss (or any other form of physical affection)   not   be of that same nature?           &nbsp;          But finally, I will say this: The greatest and most important fact is that God   must   be glorified in whatever circumstances of your relationship.      I am not saying kissing doesn&#8217;t glorify God, nor am I saying that it glorifies God   more   than not kissing. I simply ask these questions to make you think. To make you think deeper and more specifically. My hope is that God will speak to some of you and move your hearts through reading this and it will spur on a new desire for sexual, emotional and spiritual purity in your lives.           &nbsp;      ',\n",

       " \"                                   185   PEASANTS by Anton Chekhov   I NIKOLAY TCHIKILDYEEV, a waiter in the Moscow hotel, Slavyansky Bazaar, was taken ill. His legs went numb and his gait was affected, so that on one occasion, as he was going along the corridor, he tumbled and fell down with a tray full of ham and peas. He had to leave his job. All his own savings and his wife's were spent on doctors and medicines; they had nothing left to live upon. He felt dull with no work to do, and he made up his mind he must go home to the village. It is better to be ill at home, and living there is cheaper; and it is a true saying that the walls of home are a help. He reached Zhukovo towards evening. In his memories of childhood he had pictured his home as bright, snug, comfortable. Now, going into the hut, he was positively frightened; it was so dark, so crowded, so unclean. His wife Olga and his daughter Sasha, who had come with him, kept looking in bewilderment at the big untidy stove, which filled up almost half the hut and was black with soot and flies. What lots of flies! The stove was on one side, the beams lay slanting on the walls, and it looked as though the hut were just going to fall to pieces. In the corner, facing the door, under the holy images, bottle labels and newspaper cuttings were stuck on the walls instead of pictures. The poverty, the poverty! Of the grown-up people there were none at home; all were at work at the harvest. On the stove was sitting a white-headed girl of eight, unwashed and apathetic; she did not even glance at them as they came in. On the floor a white cat was rubbing itself against the oven fork. 'Puss, puss!' Sasha called to her. 'Puss!' 'She can't hear,' said the little girl; 'she has gone deaf.' 'How is that?' 'Oh, she was beaten.' Nikolay and Olga realized from the first glance what life was like here, but said nothing to one another; in silence they put down their bundles, and went out into the village street. Their hut was the third from the end, and seemed the very poorest and oldest-looking; the second was not much better; but the last one had an iron roof, and curtains in the windows. That hut stood apart, not enclosed; it was a tavern. The huts were in a single row, and the whole of the little village -- quiet and dreamy, with willows, elders, and mountain-ash trees peeping out from the yards -- had an attractive look. Beyond the peasants homesteads there was a slope down to the river, so steep and precipitous that huge stones jutted out bare here and there through the clay. Down the slope, among the stones and holes dug by the potters, ran winding paths; bits of broken pottery, some brown, some red, lay piled up in heaps, and below there stretched a broad, level, bright green meadow, from which the hay had been already carried, and in which the peasants' cattle were wandering. The river, three-quarters of a mile from the village, ran twisting and turning, with beautiful leafy banks; beyond it was again a broad meadow, a herd of cattle, long strings of white geese; then, just as on the near side, a steep ascent uphill, and on the top of the hill a hamlet, and a church with five domes, and at a little distance the manor-house. 'It's lovely here in your parts!' said Olga, crossing herself at the sight of the church. 'What space, oh Lord!' Just at that moment the bell began ringing for service (it was Saturday evening). Two little girls, down below, who were dragging up a pail of water, looked round at the church to listen to the bell. 'At this time they are serving the dinners at the Slavyansky Bazaar,' said Nikolay dreamily. Sitting on the edge of the slope, Nikolay and Olga watched the sun setting, watched the gold and crimson sky reflected in the river, in the church windows, and in the whole air -- which was soft and still and unutterably pure as it never was in Moscow. And when the sun had set the flocks and herds passed, bleating and lowing; geese flew across from the further side of the river, and all sank into silence; the soft light died away in the air, and the dusk of evening began quickly moving down upon them. Meanwhile Nikolay's father and mother, two gaunt, bent, toothless old people, just of the same height, came back. The women -- the sisters-in-law Marya and Fyokla -- who had been working on the landowner's estate beyond the river, arrived home, too. Marya, the wife of Nikolay's brother Kiryak, had six children, and Fyokla, the wife of Nikolay's brother Denis -- who had gone for a soldier -- had two; and when Nikolay, going into the hut, saw all the family, all those bodies big and little moving about on the lockers, in the hanging cradles and in all the corners, and when he saw the greed with which the old father and the women ate the black bread, dipping it in water, he realized he had made a mistake in coming here, sick, penniless, and with a family, too -- a great mistake! 'And where is Kiryak?' he asked after they had exchanged greetings. 'He is in service at the merchant's,' answered his father; 'a keeper in the woods. He is not a bad peasant, but too fond of his glass.' 'He is no great help!' said the old woman tearfully. 'Our men are a grievous lot; they bring nothing into the house, but take plenty out. Kiryak drinks, and so does the old man; it is no use hiding a sin; he knows his way to the tavern. The Heavenly Mother is wroth.' In honour of the visitors they brought out the samovar. The tea smelt of fish; the sugar was grey and looked as though it had been nibbled; cockroaches ran to and fro over the bread and among the crockery. It was disgusting to drink, and the conversation was disgusting, too -- about nothing but poverty and illnesses. But before they had time to empty their first cups there came a loud, prolonged, drunken shout from the yard: 'Ma-arya!' 'It looks as though Kiryak were coming,' said the old man. 'Speak of the devil.' All were hushed. And again, soon afterwards, the same shout, coarse and drawn-out as though it came out of the earth: 'Ma-arya!' Marya, the elder sister-in-law, turned pale and huddled against the stove, and it was strange to see the look of terror on the face of the strong, broad-shouldered, ugly woman. Her daughter, the child who had been sitting on the stove and looked so apathetic, suddenly broke into loud weeping. 'What are you howling for, you plague?' Fyokla, a handsome woman, also strong and broad-shouldered, shouted to her. 'He won't kill you, no fear!' From his old father Nikolay learned that Marya was afraid to live in the forest with Kiryak, and that when he was drunk he always came for her, made a row, and beat her mercilessly. 'Ma-arya!' the shout sounded close to the door. 'Protect me, for Christ's sake, good people!' faltered Marya, breathing as though she had been plunged into very cold water. 'Protect me, kind people. . . .' All the children in the hut began crying, and looking at them, Sasha, too, began to cry. They heard a drunken cough, and a tall, black-bearded peasant wearing a winter cap came into the hut, and was the more terrible because his face could not be seen in the dim light of the little lamp. It was Kiryak. Going up to his wife, he swung his arm and punched her in the face with his fist. Stunned by the blow, she did not utter a sound, but sat down, and her nose instantly began bleeding. 'What a disgrace! What a disgrace!' muttered the old man, clambering up on to the stove. 'Before visitors, too! It's a sin!' The old mother sat silent, bowed, lost in thought; Fyokla rocked the cradle. Evidently conscious of inspiring fear, and pleased at doing so, Kiryak seized Marya by the arm, dragged her towards the door, and bellowed like an animal in order to seem still more terrible; but at that moment he suddenly caught sight of the visitors and stopped. 'Oh, they have come, . . .' he said, letting his wife go; 'my own brother and his family. . . .' Staggering and opening wide his red, drunken eyes, he said his prayer before the image and went on: 'My brother and his family have come to the parental home . . . from Moscow, I suppose. The great capital Moscow, to be sure, the mother of cities. . . . Excuse me.' He sank down on the bench near the samovar and began drinking tea, sipping it loudly from the saucer in the midst of general silence. . . . He drank off a dozen cups, then reclined on the bench and began snoring. They began going to bed. Nikolay, as an invalid, was put on the stove with his old father; Sasha lay down on the floor, while Olga went with the other women into the barn. 'Aye, aye, dearie,' she said, lying down on the hay beside Marya; 'you won't mend your trouble with tears. Bear it in patience, that is all. It is written in the Scriptures: 'If anyone smite thee on the right cheek, offer him the left one also.' . . . Aye, aye, dearie.' Then in a low singsong murmur she told them about Moscow, about her own life, how she had been a servant in furnished lodgings. 'And in Moscow the houses are big, built of brick,' she said; 'and there are ever so many churches, forty times forty, dearie; and they are all gentry in the houses, so handsome and so proper!' Marya told her that she had not only never been in Moscow, but had not even been in their own district town; she could not read or write, and knew no prayers, not even 'Our Father.' Both she and Fyokla, the other sister-in-law, who was sitting a little way off listening, were extremely ignorant and could understand nothing. They both disliked their husbands; Marya was afraid of Kiryak, and whenever he stayed with her she was shaking with fear, and always got a headache from the fumes of vodka and tobacco with which he reeked. And in answer to the question whether she did not miss her husband, Fyokla answered with vexation: 'Miss him!' They talked a little and sank into silence. It was cool, and a cock crowed at the top of his voice near the barn, preventing them from sleeping. When the bluish morning light was already peeping through all the crevices, Fyokla got up stealthily and went out, and then they heard the sound of her bare feet running off somewhere. II Olga went to church, and took Marya with her. As they went down the path towards the meadow both were in good spirits. Olga liked the wide view, and Marya felt that in her sister-in-law she had someone near and akin to her. The sun was rising. Low down over the meadow floated a drowsy hawk. The river looked gloomy; there was a haze hovering over it here and there, but on the further bank a streak of light already stretched across the hill. The church was gleaming, and in the manor garden the rooks were cawing furiously. 'The old man is all right,' Marya told her, 'but Granny is strict; she is continually nagging. Our own grain lasted till Carnival. We buy flour now at the tavern. She is angry about it; she says we eat too much.' 'Aye, aye, dearie! Bear it in patience, that is all. It is written: 'Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden.' ' Olga spoke sedately, rhythmically, and she walked like a pilgrim woman, with a rapid, anxious step. Every day she read the gospel, read it aloud like a deacon; a great deal of it she did not understand, but the words of the gospel moved her to tears, and words like 'forasmuch as' and 'verily' she pronounced with a sweet flutter at her heart. She believed in God, in the Holy Mother, in the Saints; she believed one must not offend anyone in the world -- not simple folks, nor Germans, nor gypsies, nor Jews -- and woe even to those who have no compassion on the beasts. She believed this was written in the Holy Scriptures; and so, when she pronounced phrases from Holy Writ, even though she did not understand them, her face grew softened, compassionate, and radiant. 'What part do you come from?' Marya asked her. 'I am from Vladimir. Only I was taken to Moscow long ago, when I was eight years old.' They reached the river. On the further side a woman was standing at the water's edge, undressing. 'It's our Fyokla,' said Marya, recognizing her. 'She has been over the river to the manor yard. To the stewards. She is a shameless hussy and foul-mouthed -- fearfully!' Fyokla, young and vigorous as a girl, with her black eyebrows and her loose hair, jumped off the bank and began splashing the water with her feet, and waves ran in all directions from her. 'Shameless -- dreadfully!' repeated Marya. The river was crossed by a rickety little bridge of logs, and exactly below it in the clear, limpid water was a shoal of broad-headed mullets. The dew was glistening on the green bushes that looked into the water. There was a feeling of warmth; it was comforting! What a lovely morning! And how lovely life would have been in this world, in all likelihood, if it were not for poverty, horrible, hopeless poverty, from which one can find no refuge! One had only to look round at the village to remember vividly all that had happened the day before, and the illusion of happiness which seemed to surround them vanished instantly. They reached the church. Marya stood at the entrance, and did not dare to go farther. She did not dare to sit down either. Though they only began ringing for mass between eight and nine, she remained standing the whole time. While the gospel was being read the crowd suddenly parted to make way for the family from the great house. Two young girls in white frocks and wide-brimmed hats walked in; with them a chubby, rosy boy in a sailor suit. Their appearance touched Olga; she made up her mind from the first glance that they were refined, well-educated, handsome people. Marya looked at them from under her brows, sullenly, dejectedly, as though they were not human beings coming in, but monsters who might crush her if she did not make way for them. And every time the deacon boomed out something in his bass voice she fancied she heard 'Ma-arya!' and she shuddered. III The arrival of the visitors was already known in the village, and directly after mass a number of people gathered together in the hut. The Leonytchevs and Matvyeitchevs and the Ilyitchovs came to inquire about their relations who were in service in Moscow. All the lads of Zhukovo who could read and write were packed off to Moscow and hired out as butlers or waiters (while from the village on the other side of the river the boys all became bakers), and that had been the custom from the days of serfdom long ago when a certain Luka Ivanitch, a peasant from Zhukovo, now a legendary figure, who had been a waiter in one of the Moscow clubs, would take none but his fellow-villagers into his service, and found jobs for them in taverns and restaurants; and from that time the village of Zhukovo was always called among the inhabitants of the surrounding districts Slaveytown. Nikolay had been taken to Moscow when he was eleven, and Ivan Makaritch, one of the Matvyeitchevs, at that time a headwaiter in the 'Hermitage' garden, had put him into a situation. And now, addressing the Matvyeitchevs, Nikolay said emphatically: 'Ivan Makaritch was my benefactor, and I am bound to pray for him day and night, as it is owing to him I have become a good man.' 'My good soul!' a tall old woman, the sister of Ivan Makaritch, said tearfully, 'and not a word have we heard about him, poor dear.' 'In the winter he was in service at Omon's, and this season there was a rumour he was somewhere out of town, in gardens. . . . He has aged! In old days he would bring home as much as ten roubles a day in the summer-time, but now things are very quiet everywhere. The old man frets.' The women looked at Nikolay's feet, shod in felt boots, and at his pale face, and said mournfully: 'You are not one to get on, Nikolay Osipitch; you are not one to get on! No, indeed!' And they all made much of Sasha. She was ten years old, but she was little and very thin, and might have been taken for no more than seven. Among the other little girls, with their sunburnt faces and roughly cropped hair, dressed in long faded smocks, she with her white little face, with her big dark eyes, with a red ribbon in her hair, looked funny, as though she were some little wild creature that had been caught and brought into the hut. 'She can read, too,' Olga said in her praise, looking tenderly at her daughter. 'Read a little, child!' she said, taking the gospel from the corner. 'You read, and the good Christian people will listen.' The testament was an old and heavy one in leather binding, with dog's-eared edges, and it exhaled a smell as though monks had come into the hut. Sasha raised her eyebrows and began in a loud rhythmic chant: ' 'And the angel of the Lord . . . appeared unto Joseph, saying unto him: Rise up, and take the Babe and His mother.' ' 'The Babe and His mother,' Olga repeated, and flushed all over with emotion. ' 'And flee into Egypt, . . . and tarry there until such time as . . .' ' At the word 'tarry' Olga could not refrain from tears. Looking at her, Marya began to whimper, and after her Ivan Makaritch's sister. The old father cleared his throat, and bustled about to find something to give his grand-daughter, but, finding nothing, gave it up with a wave of his hand. And when the reading was over the neighbours dispersed to their homes, feeling touched and very much pleased with Olga and Sasha. As it was a holiday, the family spent the whole day at home. The old woman, whom her husband, her daughters-in-law, her grandchildren all alike called Granny, tried to do everything herself; she heated the stove and set the samovar with her own hands, even waited at the midday meal, and then complained that she was worn out with work. And all the time she was uneasy for fear someone should eat a piece too much, or that her husband and daughters-in-law would sit idle. At one time she would hear the tavern-keeper's geese going at the back of the huts to her kitchen-garden, and she would run out of the hut with a long stick and spend half an hour screaming shrilly by her cabbages, which were as gaunt and scraggy as herself; at another time she fancied that a crow had designs on her chickens, and she rushed to attack it with loud words of abuse. She was cross and grumbling from morning till night. And often she raised such an outcry that passers-by stopped in the street. She was not affectionate towards the old man, reviling him as a lazy-bones and a plague. He was not a responsible, reliable peasant, and perhaps if she had not been continually nagging at him he would not have worked at all, but would have simply sat on the stove and talked. He talked to his son at great length about certain enemies of his, complained of the insults he said he had to put up with every day from the neighbours, and it was tedious to listen to him. 'Yes,' he would say, standing with his arms akimbo, 'yes. . . . A week after the Exaltation of the Cross I sold my hay willingly at thirty kopecks a pood. . . . Well and good. . . . So you see I was taking the hay in the morning with a good will; I was interfering with no one. In an unlucky hour I see the village elder, Antip Syedelnikov, coming out of the tavern. 'Where are you taking it, you ruffian?' says he, and takes me by the ear.' Kiryak had a fearful headache after his drinking bout, and was ashamed to face his brother. 'What vodka does! Ah, my God!' he muttered, shaking his aching head. 'For Christ's sake, forgive me, brother and sister; I'm not happy myself.' As it was a holiday, they bought a herring at the tavern and made a soup of the herring's head. At midday they all sat down to drink tea, and went on drinking it for a long time, till they were all perspiring; they looked positively swollen from the tea-drinking, and after it began sipping the broth from the herring's head, all helping themselves out of one bowl. But the herring itself Granny had hidden. In the evening a potter began firing pots on the ravine. In the meadow below the girls got up a choral dance and sang songs. They played the concertina. And on the other side of the river a kiln for baking pots was lighted, too, and the girls sang songs, and in the distance the singing sounded soft and musical. The peasants were noisy in and about the tavern. They were singing with drunken voices, each on his own account, and swearing at one another, so that Olga could only shudder and say: 'Oh, holy Saints!' She was amazed that the abuse was incessant, and those who were loudest and most persistent in this foul language were the old men who were so near their end. And the girls and children heard the swearing, and were not in the least disturbed by it, and it was evident that they were used to it from their cradles. It was past midnight, the kilns on both sides of the river were put out, but in the meadow below and in the tavern the merrymaking still went on. The old father and Kiryak, both drunk, walking arm-in-arm and jostling against each other's shoulders, went to the barn where Olga and Marya were lying. 'Let her alone,' the old man persuaded him; 'let her alone. . . . She is a harmless woman. . . . It's a sin. . . .' 'Ma-arya!' shouted Kiryak. 'Let her be. . . . It's a sin. . . . She is not a bad woman.' Both stopped by the barn and went on. 'I lo-ove the flowers of the fi-ield,' the old man began singing suddenly in a high, piercing tenor. 'I lo-ove to gather them in the meadows!' Then he spat, and with a filthy oath went into the hut. IV Granny put Sasha by her kitchen-garden and told her to keep watch that the geese did not go in. It was a hot August day. The tavernkeeper's geese could make their way into the kitchen-garden by the backs of the huts, but now they were busily engaged picking up oats by the tavern, peacefully conversing together, and only the gander craned his head high as though trying to see whether the old woman were coming with her stick. The other geese might come up from below, but they were now grazing far away the other side of the river, stretched out in a long white garland about the meadow. Sasha stood about a little, grew weary, and, seeing that the geese were not coming, went away to the ravine. There she saw Marya's eldest daughter Motka, who was standing motionless on a big stone, staring at the church. Marya had given birth to thirteen children, but she only had six living, all girls, not one boy, and the eldest was eight. Motka in a long smock was standing barefooted in the full sunshine; the sun was blazing down right on her head, but she did not notice that, and seemed as though turned to stone. Sasha stood beside her and said, looking at the church: 'God lives in the church. Men have lamps and candles, but God has little green and red and blue lamps like little eyes. At night God walks about the church, and with Him the Holy Mother of God and Saint Nikolay, thud, thud, thud! . . . And the watchman is terrified, terrified! Aye, aye, dearie,' she added, imitating her mother. 'And when the end of the world comes all the churches will be carried up to heaven.' 'With the-ir be-ells?' Motka asked in her deep voice, drawling every syllable. 'With their bells. And when the end of the world comes the good will go to Paradise, but the angry will burn in fire eternal and unquenchable, dearie. To my mother as well as to Marya God will say: 'You never offended anyone, and for that go to the right to Paradise'; but to Kiryak and Granny He will say: 'You go to the left into the fire.' And anyone who has eaten meat in Lent will go into the fire, too.' She looked upwards at the sky, opening wide her eyes, and said: 'Look at the sky without winking, you will see angels.' Motka began looking at the sky, too, and a minute passed in silence. 'Do you see them?' asked Sasha. 'I don't,' said Motka in her deep voice. 'But I do. Little angels are flying about the sky and flap, flap with their little wings as though they were gnats.' Motka thought for a little, with her eyes on the ground, and asked: 'Will Granny burn?' 'She will, dearie.' From the stone an even gentle slope ran down to the bottom, covered with soft green grass, which one longed to lie down on or to touch with one's hands. . . Sasha lay down and rolled to the bottom. Motka with a grave, severe face, taking a deep breath, lay down, too, and rolled to the bottom, and in doing so tore her smock from the hem to the shoulder. 'What fun it is!' said Sasha, delighted. They walked up to the top to roll down again, but at that moment they heard a shrill, familiar voice. Oh, how awful it was! Granny, a toothless, bony, hunchbacked figure, with short grey hair which was fluttering in the wind, was driving the geese out of the kitchen-garden with a long stick, shouting. 'They have trampled all the cabbages, the damned brutes! I'd cut your throats, thrice accursed plagues! Bad luck to you!' She saw the little girls, flung down the stick and picked up a switch, and, seizing Sasha by the neck with her fingers, thin and hard as the gnarled branches of a tree, began whipping her. Sasha cried with pain and terror, while the gander, waddling and stretching his neck, went up to the old woman and hissed at her, and when he went back to his flock all the geese greeted him approvingly with 'Ga-ga-ga!' Then Granny proceeded to whip Motka, and in this Motka's smock was torn again. Feeling in despair, and crying loudly, Sasha went to the hut to complain. Motka followed her; she, too, was crying on a deeper note, without wiping her tears, and her face was as wet as though it had been dipped in water. 'Holy Saints!' cried Olga, aghast, as the two came into the hut. 'Queen of Heaven!' Sasha began telling her story, while at the same time Granny walked in with a storm of shrill cries and abuse; then Fyokla flew into a rage, and there was an uproar in the hut. 'Never mind, never mind!' Olga, pale and upset, tried to comfort them, stroking Sasha's head. 'She is your grandmother; it's a sin to be angry with her. Never mind, my child.' Nikolay, who was worn out already by the everlasting hubbub, hunger, stifling fumes, filth, who hated and despised the poverty, who was ashamed for his wife and daughter to see his father and mother, swung his legs off the stove and said in an irritable, tearful voice, addressing his mother: 'You must not beat her! You have no right to beat her!' 'You lie rotting on the stove, you wretched creature!' Fyokla shouted at him spitefully. 'The devil brought you all on us, eating us out of house and home.' Sasha and Motka and all the little girls in the hut huddled on the stove in the corner behind Nikolay's back, and from that refuge listened in silent terror, and the beating of their little hearts could be distinctly heard. Whenever there is someone in a family who has long been ill, and hopelessly ill, there come painful moments when all timidly, secretly, at the bottom of their hearts long for his death; and only the children fear the death of someone near them, and always feel horrified at the thought of it. And now the children, with bated breath, with a mournful look on their faces, gazed at Nikolay and thought that he was soon to die; and they wanted to cry and to say something friendly and compassionate to him. He pressed close to Olga, as though seeking protection, and said to her softly in a quavering voice: 'Olya darling, I can't stay here longer. It's more than I can bear. For God's sake, for Christ's sake, write to your sister Klavdia Abramovna. Let her sell and pawn everything she has; let her send us the money. We will go away from here. Oh, Lord,' he went on miserably, 'to have one peep at Moscow! If I could see it in my dreams, the dear place!' And when the evening came on, and it was dark in the hut, it was so dismal that it was hard to utter a word. Granny, very ill-tempered, soaked some crusts of rye bread in a cup, and was a long time, a whole hour, sucking at them. Marya, after milking the cow, brought in a pail of milk and set it on a bench; then Granny poured it from the pail into a jug just as slowly and deliberately, evidently pleased that it was now the Fast of the Assumption, so that no one would drink milk and it would be left untouched. And she only poured out a very little in a saucer for Fyokla's baby. When Marya and she carried the jug down to the cellar Motka suddenly stirred, clambered down from the stove, and going to the bench where stood the wooden cup full of crusts, sprinkled into it some milk from the saucer. Granny, coming back into the hut, sat down to her soaked crusts again, while Sasha and Motka, sitting on the stove, gazed at her, and they were glad that she had broken her fast and now would go to hell. They were comforted and lay down to sleep, and Sasha as she dozed off to sleep imagined the Day of Judgment: a huge fire was burning, somewhat like a potter's kiln, and the Evil One, with horns like a cow's, and black all over, was driving Granny into the fire with a long stick, just as Granny herself had been driving the geese. V On the day of the Feast of the Assumption, between ten and eleven in the evening, the girls and lads who were merrymaking in the meadow suddenly raised a clamour and outcry, and ran in the direction of the village; and those who were above on the edge of the ravine could not for the first moment make out what was the matter. 'Fire! Fire!' they heard desperate shouts from below. 'The village is on fire!' Those who were sitting above looked round, and a terrible and extraordinary spectacle met their eyes. On the thatched roof of one of the end cottages stood a column of flame, seven feet high, which curled round and scattered sparks in all directions as though it were a fountain. And all at once the whole roof burst into bright flame, and the crackling of the fire was audible. The light of the moon was dimmed, and the whole village was by now bathed in a red quivering glow: black shadows moved over the ground, there was a smell of burning, and those who ran up from below were all gasping and could not speak for trembling; they jostled against each other, fell down, and they could hardly see in the unaccustomed light, and did not recognize each other. It was terrible. What seemed particularly dreadful was that doves were flying over the fire in the smoke; and in the tavern, where they did not yet know of the fire, they were still singing and playing the concertina as though there were nothing the matter. 'Uncle Semyon's on fire,' shouted a loud, coarse voice. Marya was fussing about round her hut, weeping and wringing her hands, while her teeth chattered, though the fire was a long way off at the other end of the village. Nikolay came out in high felt boots, the children ran out in their little smocks. Near the village constable's hut an iron sheet was struck. Boom, boom, boom! . . . floated through the air, and this repeated, persistent sound sent a pang to the heart and turned one cold. The old women stood with the holy ikons. Sheep, calves, cows were driven out of the back-yards into the street; boxes, sheepskins, tubs were carried out. A black stallion, who was kept apart from the drove of horses because he kicked and injured them, on being set free ran once or twice up and down the village, neighing and pawing the ground; then suddenly stopped short near a cart and began kicking it with his hind-legs. They began ringing the bells in the church on the other side of the river. Near the burning hut it was hot and so light that one could distinctly see every blade of grass. Semyon, a red-haired peasant with a long nose, wearing a reefer-jacket and a cap pulled down right over his ears, sat on one of the boxes which they had succeeded in bringing out: his wife was lying on her face, moaning and unconscious. A little old man of eighty, with a big beard, who looked like a gnome -- not one of the villagers, though obviously connected in some way with the fire -- walked about bareheaded, with a white bundle in his arms. The glare was reflected on his bald head. The village elder, Antip Syedelnikov, as swarthy and black-haired as a gypsy, went up to the hut with an axe, and hacked out the windows one after another -- no one knew why -- then began chopping up the roof. 'Women, water!' he shouted. 'Bring the engine! Look sharp!' The peasants, who had been drinking in the tavern just before, dragged the engine up. They were all drunk; they kept stumbling and falling down, and all had a helpless expression and tears in their eyes. 'Wenches, water!' shouted the elder, who was drunk, too. 'Look sharp, wenches!' The women and the girls ran downhill to where there was a spring, and kept hauling pails and buckets of water up the hill, and, pouring it into the engine, ran down again. Olga and Marya and Sasha and Motka all brought water. The women and the boys pumped the water; the pipe hissed, and the elder, directing it now at the door, now at the windows, held back the stream with his finger, which made it hiss more sharply still. 'Bravo, Antip!' voices shouted approvingly. 'Do your best.' Antip went inside the hut into the fire and shouted from within. 'Pump! Bestir yourselves, good Christian folk, in such a terrible mischance!' The peasants stood round in a crowd, doing nothing but staring at the fire. No one knew what to do, no one had the sense to do anything, though there were stacks of wheat, hay, barns, and piles of faggots standing all round. Kiryak and old Osip, his father, both tipsy, were standing there, too. And as though to justify his doing nothing, old Osip said, addressing the woman who lay on the ground: 'What is there to trouble about, old girl! The hut is insured -- why are you taking on?' Semyon, addressing himself first to one person and then to another, kept describing how the fire had started. 'That old man, the one with the bundle, a house-serf of General Zhukov's. . . . He was cook at our general's, God rest his soul! He came over this evening: 'Let me stay the night,' says he. . . . Well, we had a glass, to be sure. . . . The wife got the samovar -- she was going to give the old fellow a cup of tea, and in an unlucky hour she set the samovar in the entrance. The sparks from the chimney must have blown straight up to the thatch; that's how it was. We were almost burnt ourselves. And the old fellow's cap has been burnt; what a shame!' And the sheet of iron was struck indefatigably, and the bells kept ringing in the church the other side of the river. In the glow of the fire Olga, breathless, looking with horror at the red sheep and the pink doves flying in the smoke, kept running down the hill and up again. It seemed to her that the ringing went to her heart with a sharp stab, that the fire would never be over, that Sasha was lost. . . . And when the ceiling of the hut fell in with a crash, the thought that now the whole village would be burnt made her weak and faint, and she could not go on fetching water, but sat down on the ravine, setting the pail down near her; beside her and below her, the peasant women sat wailing as though at a funeral. Then the stewards and watchmen from the estate the other side of the river arrived in two carts, bringing with them a fire-engine. A very young student in an unbuttoned white tunic rode up on horseback. There was the thud of axes. They put a ladder to the burning framework of the house, and five men ran up it at once. Foremost of them all was the student, who was red in the face and shouting in a harsh hoarse voice, and in a tone as though putting out fires was a thing he was used to. They pulled the house to pieces, a beam at a time; they dragged away the corn, the hurdles, and the stacks that were near. 'Don't let them break it up!' cried stern voices in the crowd. 'Don't let them.' Kiryak made his way up to the hut with a resolute air, as though he meant to prevent the newcomers from breaking up the hut, but one of the workmen turned him back with a blow in his neck. There was the sound of laughter, the workman dealt him another blow, Kiryak fell down, and crawled back into the crowd on his hands and knees. Two handsome girls in hats, probably the student's sisters, came from the other side of the river. They stood a little way off, looking at the fire. The beams that had been dragged apart were no longer burning, but were smoking vigorously; the student, who was working the hose, turned the water, first on the beams, then on the peasants, then on the women who were bringing the water. 'George!' the girls called to him reproachfully in anxiety, 'George!' The fire was over. And only when they began to disperse they noticed that the day was breaking, that everyone was pale and rather dark in the face, as it always seems in the early morning when the last stars are going out. As they separated, the peasants laughed and made jokes about General Zhukov's cook and his cap which had been burnt; they already wanted to turn the fire into a joke, and even seemed sorry that it had so soon been put out. 'How well you extinguished the fire, sir!' said Olga to the student. 'You ought to come to us in Moscow: there we have a fire every day.' 'Why, do you come from Moscow?' asked one of the young ladies. 'Yes, miss. My husband was a waiter at the Slavyansky Bazaar. And this is my daughter,' she said, indicating Sasha, who was cold and huddling up to her. 'She is a Moscow girl, too.' The two young ladies said something in French to the student, and he gave Sasha a twenty-kopeck piece. Old Father Osip saw this, and there was a gleam of hope in his face. 'We must thank God, your honour, there was no wind,' he said, addressing the student, 'or else we should have been all burnt up together. Your honour, kind gentlefolks,' he added in embarrassment in a lower tone, 'the morning's chilly . . . something to warm one . . . half a bottle to your honour's health.' Nothing was given him, and clearing his throat he slouched home. Olga stood afterwards at the end of the street and watched the two carts crossing the river by the ford and the gentlefolks walking across the meadow; a carriage was waiting for them the other side of the river. Going into the hut, she described to her husband with enthusiasm: 'Such good people! And so beautiful! The young ladies were like cherubim.' 'Plague take them!' Fyokla, sleepy, said spitefully. VI Marya thought herself unhappy, and said that she would be very glad to die; Fyokla, on the other hand, found all this life to her taste: the poverty, the uncleanliness, and the incessant quarrelling. She ate what was given her without discrimination; slept anywhere, on whatever came to hand. She would empty the slops just at the porch, would splash them out from the doorway, and then walk barefoot through the puddle. And from the very first day she took a dislike to Olga and Nikolay just because they did not like this life. 'We shall see what you'll find to eat here, you Moscow gentry!' she said malignantly. 'We shall see!' One morning, it was at the beginning of September, Fyokla, vigorous, good-looking, and rosy from the cold, brought up two pails of water; Marya and Olga were sitting meanwhile at the table drinking tea. 'Tea and sugar,' said Fyokla sarcastically. 'The fine ladies!' she added, setting down the pails. 'You have taken to the fashion of tea every day. You better look out that you don't burst with your tea-drinking,' she went on, looking with hatred at Olga. 'That's how you have come by your fat mug, having a good time in Moscow, you lump of flesh!' She swung the yoke and hit Olga such a blow on the shoulder that the two sisters-in-law could only clasp their hands and say: 'Oh, holy Saints!' Then Fyokla went down to the river to wash the clothes, swearing all the time so loudly that she could be heard in the hut. The day passed and was followed by the long autumn evening. They wound silk in the hut; everyone did it except Fyokla; she had gone over the river. They got the silk from a factory close by, and the whole family working together earned next to nothing, twenty kopecks a week. 'Things were better in the old days under the gentry,' said the old father as he wound silk. 'You worked and ate and slept, everything in its turn. At dinner you had cabbage-soup and boiled grain, and at supper the same again. Cucumbers and cabbage in plenty: you could eat to your heart's content, as much as you wanted. And there was more strictness. Everyone minded what he was about.' The hut was lighted by a single little lamp, which burned dimly and smoked. When someone screened the lamp and a big shadow fell across the window, the bright moonlight could be seen. Old Osip, speaking slowly, told them how they used to live before the emancipation; how in those very parts, where life was now so poor and so dreary, they used to hunt with harriers, greyhounds, retrievers, and when they went out as beaters the peasants were given vodka; how whole waggonloads of game used to be sent to Moscow for the young masters; how the bad were beaten with rods or sent away to the Tver estate, while the good were rewarded. And Granny told them something, too. She remembered everything, positively everything. She described her mistress, a kind, God-fearing woman, whose husband was a profligate and a rake, and all of whose daughters made unlucky marriages: one married a drunkard, another married a workman, the other eloped secretly (Granny herself, at that time a young girl, helped in the elopement), and they had all three as well as their mother died early from grief. And remembering all this, Granny positively began to shed tears. All at once someone knocked at the door, and they all started. 'Uncle Osip, give me a night's lodging.' The little bald old man, General Zhukov's cook, the one whose cap had been burnt, walked in. He sat down and listened, then he, too, began telling stories of all sorts. Nikolay, sitting on the stove with his legs hanging down, listened and asked questions about the dishes that were prepared in the old days for the gentry. They talked of rissoles, cutlets, various soups and sauces, and the cook, who remembered everything very well, mentioned dishes that are no longer served. There was one, for instance -- a dish made of bulls' eyes, which was called 'waking up in the morning.' 'And used you to do cutlets à la maréchal?' asked Nikolay. 'No.' Nikolay shook his head reproachfully and said: 'Tut, tut! You were not much of a cook!' The little girls sitting and lying on the stove stared down without blinking; it seemed as though there were a great many of them, like cherubim in the clouds. They liked the stories: they were breathless; they shuddered and turned pale with alternate rapture and terror, and they listened breathlessly, afraid to stir, to Granny, whose stories were the most interesting of all. They lay down to sleep in silence; and the old people, troubled and excited by their reminiscences, thought how precious was youth, of which, whatever it might have been like, nothing was left in the memory but what was living, joyful, touching, and how terribly cold was death, which was not far off, better not think of it! The lamp died down. And the dusk, and the two little windows sharply defined by the moonlight, and the stillness and the creak of the cradle, reminded them for some reason that life was over, that nothing one could do would bring it back. . . . You doze off, you forget yourself, and suddenly someone touches your shoulder or breathes on your cheek -- and sleep is gone; your body feels cramped, and thoughts of death keep creeping into your mind. You turn on the other side: death is forgotten, but old dreary, sickening thoughts of poverty, of food, of how dear flour is getting, stray through the mind, and a little later again you remember that life is over and you cannot bring it back. . . . 'Oh, Lord!' sighed the cook. Someone gave a soft, soft tap at the window. It must be Fyokla come back. Olga got up, and yawning and whispering a prayer, opened the door, then drew the bolt in the outer room, but no one came in; only from the street came a cold draught and a sudden brightness from the moonlight. The street, still and deserted, and the moon itself floating across the sky, could be seen at the open door. 'Who is there?' called Olga. 'I,' she heard the answer -- 'it is I.' Near the door, crouching against the wall, stood Fyokla, absolutely naked. She was shivering with cold, her teeth were chattering, and in the bright moonlight she looked very pale, strange, and beautiful. The shadows on her, and the bright moonlight on her skin, stood out vividly, and her dark eyebrows and firm, youthful bosom were defined with peculiar distinctness. 'The ruffians over there undressed me and turned me out like this,' she said. 'I've come home without my clothes . . . naked as my mother bore me. Bring me something to put on.' 'But go inside!' Olga said softly, beginning to shiver, too. 'I don't want the old folks to see.' Granny was, in fact, already stirring and muttering, and the old father asked: 'Who is there?' Olga brought her own smock and skirt, dressed Fyokla, and then both went softly into the inner room, trying not to make a noise with the door. 'Is that you, you sleek one?' Granny grumbled angrily, guessing who it was. 'Fie upon you, nightwalker! . . . Bad luck to you!' 'It's all right, it's all right,' whispered Olga, wrapping Fyokla up; 'it's all right, dearie.' All was stillness again. They always slept badly; everyone was kept awake by something worrying and persistent: the old man by the pain in his back, Granny by anxiety and anger, Marya by terror, the children by itch and hunger. Now, too, their sleep was troubled; they kept turning over from one side to the other, talking in their sleep, getting up for a drink. Fyokla suddenly broke into a loud, coarse howl, but immediately checked herself, and only uttered sobs from time to time, growing softer and on a lower note, until she relapsed into silence. From time to time from the other side of the river there floated the sound of the beating of the hours; but the time seemed somehow strange -- five was struck and then three. 'Oh Lord!' sighed the cook. Looking at the windows, it was difficult to tell whether it was still moonlight or whether the dawn had begun. Marya got up and went out, and she could be heard milking the cows and saying, 'Stea-dy!' Granny went out, too. It was still dark in the hut, but all the objects in it could be discerned. Nikolay, who had not slept all night, got down from the stove. He took his dress-coat out of a green box, put it on, and going to the window, stroked the sleeves and took hold of the coat-tails -- and smiled. Then he carefully took off the coat, put it away in his box, and lay down again. Marya came in again and began lighting the stove. She was evidently hardly awake, and seemed dropping asleep as she walked. Probably she had had some dream, or the stories of the night before came into her mind as, stretching luxuriously before the stove, she said: 'No, freedom is better.' VII The master arrived -- that was what they called the police inspector. When he would come and what he was coming for had been known for the last week. There were only forty households in Zhukovo, but more than two thousand roubles of arrears of rates and taxes had accumulated. The police inspector stopped at the tavern. He drank there two glasses of tea, and then went on foot to the village elder's hut, near which a crowd of those who were in debt stood waiting. The elder, Antip Syedelnikov, was, in spite of his youth -- he was only a little over thirty -- strict and always on the side of the authorities, though he himself was poor and did not pay his taxes regularly. Evidently he enjoyed being elder, and liked the sense of authority, which he could only display by strictness. In the village council the peasants were afraid of him and obeyed him. It would sometimes happen that he would pounce on a drunken man in the street or near the tavern, tie his hands behind him, and put him in the lock-up. On one occasion he even put Granny in the lock-up because she went to the village council instead of Osip, and began swearing, and he kept her there for a whole day and night. He had never lived in a town or read a book, but somewhere or other had picked up various learned expressions, and loved to make use of them in conversation, and he was respected for this though he was not always understood. When Osip came into the village elder's hut with his tax book, the police inspector, a lean old man with a long grey beard, in a grey tunic, was sitting at a table in the passage, writing something. It was clean in the hut; all the walls were dotted with pictures cut out of the illustrated papers, and in the most conspicuous place near the ikon there was a portrait of the Battenburg who was the Prince of Bulgaria. By the table stood Antip Syedelnikov with his arms folded. 'There is one hundred and nineteen roubles standing against him,' he said when it came to Osip's turn. 'Before Easter he paid a rouble, and he has not paid a kopeck since.' The police inspector raised his eyes to Osip and asked: 'Why is this, brother?' 'Show Divine mercy, your honour,' Osip began, growing agitated. 'Allow me to say last year the gentleman at Lutorydsky said to me, 'Osip,' he said, 'sell your hay . . . you sell it,' he said. Well, I had a hundred poods for sale; the women mowed it on the water-meadow. Well, we struck a bargain all right, willingly. . . .' He complained of the elder, and kept turning round to the peasants as though inviting them to bear witness; his face flushed red and perspired, and his eyes grew sharp and angry. 'I don't know why you are saying all this,' said the police inspector. 'I am asking you . . . I am asking you why you don't pay your arrears. You don't pay, any of you, and am I to be responsible for you?' 'I can't do it.' 'His words have no sequel, your honour,' said the elder. 'The Tchikildyeevs certainly are of a defective class, but if you will just ask the others, the root of it all is vodka, and they are a very bad lot. With no sort of understanding.' The police inspector wrote something down, and said to Osip quietly, in an even tone, as though he were asking him for water: 'Be off.' Soon he went away; and when he got into his cheap chaise and cleared his throat, it could be seen from the very expression of his long thin back that he was no longer thinking of Osip or of the village elder, nor of the Zhukovo arrears, but was thinking of his own affairs. Before he had gone three-quarters of a mile Antip was already carrying off the samovar from the Tchikildyeevs' cottage, followed by Granny, screaming shrilly and straining her throat: 'I won't let you have it, I won't let you have it, damn you!' He walked rapidly with long steps, and she pursued him panting, almost falling over, a bent, ferocious figure; her kerchief slipped on to her shoulders, her grey hair with greenish lights on it was blown about in the wind. She suddenly stopped short, and like a genuine rebel, fell to beating her breast with her fists and shouting louder than ever in a sing-song voice, as though she were sobbing: 'Good Christians and believers in God! Neighbours, they have ill-treated me! Kind friends, they have oppressed me! Oh, oh! dear people, take my part.' 'Granny, Granny!' said the village elder sternly, 'have some sense in your head!' It was hopelessly dreary in the Tchikildyeevs' hut without the samovar; there was something humiliating in this loss, insulting, as though the honour of the hut had been outraged. Better if the elder had carried off the table, all the benches, all the pots -- it would not have seemed so empty. Granny screamed, Marya cried, and the little girls, looking at her, cried, too. The old father, feeling guilty, sat in the corner with bowed head and said nothing. And Nikolay, too, was silent. Granny loved him and was sorry for him, but now, forgetting her pity, she fell upon him with abuse, with reproaches, shaking her fist right in his face. She shouted that it was all his fault; why had he sent them so little when he boasted in his letters that he was getting fifty roubles a month at the Slavyansky Bazaar? Why had he come, and with his family, too? If he died, where was the money to come from for his funeral . . . ? And it was pitiful to look at Nikolay, Olga, and Sasha. The old father cleared his throat, took his cap, and went off to the village elder. Antip was soldering something by the stove, puffing out his cheeks; there was a smell of burning. His children, emaciated and unwashed, no better than the Tchikildyeevs, were scrambling about the floor; his wife, an ugly, freckled woman with a prominent stomach, was winding silk. They were a poor, unlucky family, and Antip was the only one who looked vigorous and handsome. On a bench there were five samovars standing in a row. The old man said his prayer to Battenburg and said: 'Antip, show the Divine mercy. Give me back the samovar, for Christ's sake!' 'Bring three roubles, then you shall have it. 'I can't do it!' Antip puffed out his cheeks, the fire roared and hissed, and the glow was reflected in the samovar. The old man crumpled up his cap and said after a moment's thought: 'You give it me back.' The swarthy elder looked quite black, and was like a magician; he turned round to Osip and said sternly and rapidly: 'It all depends on the rural captain. On the twenty-sixth instant you can state the grounds for your dissatisfaction before the administrative session, verbally or in writing.' Osip did not understand a word, but he was satisfied with that and went home. Ten days later the police inspector came again, stayed an hour and went away. During those days the weather had changed to cold and windy; the river had been frozen for some time past, but still there was no snow, and people found it difficult to get about. On the eve of a holiday some of the neighbours came in to Osip's to sit and have a talk. They did not light the lamp, as it would have been a sin to work, but talked in the darkness. There were some items of news, all rather unpleasant. In two or three households hens had been taken for the arrears, and had been sent to the district police station, and there they had died because no one had fed them; they had taken sheep, and while they were being driven away tied to one another, shifted into another cart at each village, one of them had died. And now they were discussing the question, who was to blame? 'The Zemstvo,' said Osip. 'Who else?' 'Of course it is the Zemstvo.' The Zemstvo was blamed for everything -- for the arrears, and for the oppressions, and for the failure of the crops, though no one of them knew what was meant by the Zemstvo. And this dated from the time when well-to-do peasants who had factories, shops, and inns of their own were members of the Zemstvos, were dissatisfied with them, and took to swearing at the Zemstvos in their factories and inns. They talked of God's not sending the snow; they had to bring in wood for fuel, and there was no driving nor walking in the frozen ruts. In old days fifteen to twenty years ago conversation was much more interesting in Zhukovo. In those days every old man looked as though he were treasuring some secret; as though he knew something and was expecting something. They used to talk about an edict in golden letters, about the division of lands, about new land, about treasures; they hinted at something. Now the people of Zhukovo had no mystery at all; their whole life was bare and open in the sight of all, and they could talk of nothing but poverty, food, there being no snow yet. . . . There was a pause. Then they thought again of the hens, of the sheep, and began discussing whose fault it was. 'The Zemstvo,' said Osip wearily. 'Who else?' VIII The parish church was nearly five miles away at Kosogorovo, and the peasants only attended it when they had to do so for baptisms, weddings, or funerals; they went to the services at the church across the river. On holidays in fine weather the girls dressed up in their best and went in a crowd together to church, and it was a cheering sight to see them in their red, yellow, and green dresses cross the meadow; in bad weather they all stayed at home. They went for the sacrament to the parish church. From each of those who did not manage in Lent to go to confession in readiness for the sacrament the parish priest, going the round of the huts with the cross at Easter, took fifteen kopecks. The old father did not believe in God, for he hardly ever thought about Him; he recognized the supernatural, but considered it was entirely the women's concern, and when religion or miracles were discussed before him, or a question were put to him, he would say reluctantly, scratching himself: 'Who can tell!' Granny believed, but her faith was somewhat hazy; everything was mixed up in her memory, and she could scarcely begin to think of sins, of death, of the salvation of the soul, before poverty and her daily cares took possession of her mind, and she instantly forgot what she was thinking about. She did not remember the prayers, and usually in the evenings, before lying down to sleep, she would stand before the ikons and whisper: 'Holy Mother of Kazan, Holy Mother of Smolensk, Holy Mother of Troerutchitsy. . .' Marya and Fyokla crossed themselves, fasted, and took the sacrament every year, but understood nothing. The children were not taught their prayers, nothing was told them about God, and no moral principles were instilled into them; they were only forbidden to eat meat or milk in Lent. In the other families it was much the same: there were few who believed, few who understood. At the same time everyone loved the Holy Scripture, loved it with a tender, reverent love; but they had no Bible, there was no one to read it and explain it, and because Olga sometimes read them the gospel, they respected her, and they all addressed her and Sasha as though they were superior to themselves. For church holidays and services Olga often went to neighbouring villages, and to the district town, in which there were two monasteries and twenty-seven churches. She was dreamy, and when she was on these pilgrimages she quite forgot her family, and only when she got home again suddenly made the joyful discovery that she had a husband and daughter, and then would say, smiling and radiant: 'God has sent me blessings!' What went on in the village worried her and seemed to her revolting. On Elijah's Day they drank, at the Assumption they drank, at the Ascension they drank. The Feast of the Intercession was the parish holiday for Zhukovo, and the peasants used to drink then for three days; they squandered on drink fifty roubles of money belonging to the Mir, and then collected more for vodka from all the households. On the first day of the feast the Tchikildyeevs killed a sheep and ate of it in the morning, at dinner-time, and in the evening; they ate it ravenously, and the children got up at night to eat more. Kiryak was fearfully drunk for three whole days; he drank up everything, even his boots and cap, and beat Marya so terribly that they had to pour water over her. And then they were all ashamed and sick. However, even in Zhukovo, in this 'Slaveytown,' there was once an outburst of genuine religious enthusiasm. It was in August, when throughout the district they carried from village to village the Holy Mother, the giver of life. It was still and overcast on the day when they expected Her at Zhukovo. The girls set off in the morning to meet the ikon, in their bright holiday dresses, and brought Her towards the evening, in procession with the cross and with singing, while the bells pealed in the church across the river. An immense crowd of villagers and strangers flooded the street; there was noise, dust, a great crush. . . . And the old father and Granny and Kiryak -- all stretched out their hands to the ikon, looked eagerly at it and said, weeping: 'Defender! Mother! Defender!' All seemed suddenly to realize that there was not an empty void between earth and heaven, that the rich and the powerful had not taken possession of everything, that there was still a refuge from injury, from slavish bondage, from crushing, unendurable poverty, from the terrible vodka. 'Defender! Mother!' sobbed Marya. 'Mother!' But the thanksgiving service ended and the ikon was carried away, and everything went on as before; and again there was a sound of coarse drunken oaths from the tavern. Only the well-to-do peasants were afraid of death; the richer they were the less they believed in God, and in the salvation of souls, and only through fear of the end of the world put up candles and had services said for them, to be on the safe side. The peasants who were rather poorer were not afraid of death. The old father and Granny were told to their faces that they had lived too long, that it was time they were dead, and they did not mind. They did not hinder Fyokla from saying in Nikolay's presence that when Nikolay died her husband Denis would get exemption -- to return home from the army. And Marya, far from fearing death, regretted that it was so slow in coming, and was glad when her children died. Death they did not fear, but of every disease they had an exaggerated terror. The merest trifle was enough -- a stomach upset, a slight chill, and Granny would be wrapped up on the stove, and would begin moaning loudly and incessantly: 'I am dy-ing!' The old father hurried off for the priest, and Granny received the sacrament and extreme unction. They often talked of colds, of worms, of tumours which move in the stomach and coil round to the heart. Above all, they were afraid of catching cold, and so put on thick clothes even in the summer and warmed themselves at the stove. Granny was fond of being doctored, and often went to the hospital, where she used to say she was not seventy, but fifty-eight; she supposed that if the doctor knew her real age he would not treat her, but would say it was time she died instead of taking medicine. She usually went to the hospital early in the morning, taking with her two or three of the little girls, and came back in the evening, hungry and ill-tempered -- with drops for herself and ointments for the little girls. Once she took Nikolay, who swallowed drops for a fortnight afterwards, and said he felt better. Granny knew all the doctors and their assistants and the wise men for twenty miles round, and not one of them she liked. At the Intercession, when the priest made the round of the huts with the cross, the deacon told her that in the town near the prison lived an old man who had been a medical orderly in the army, and who made wonderful cures, and advised her to try him. Granny took his advice. When the first snow fell she drove to the town and fetched an old man with a big beard, a converted Jew, in a long gown, whose face was covered with blue veins. There were outsiders at work in the hut at the time: an old tailor, in terrible spectacles, was cutting a waistcoat out of some rags, and two young men were making felt boots out of wool; Kiryak, who had been dismissed from his place for drunkenness, and now lived at home, was sitting beside the tailor mending a bridle. And it was crowded, stifling, and noisome in the hut. The converted Jew examined Nikolay and said that it was necessary to try cupping. He put on the cups, and the old tailor, Kiryak, and the little girls stood round and looked on, and it seemed to them that they saw the disease being drawn out of Nikolay; and Nikolay, too, watched how the cups suckling at his breast gradually filled with dark blood, and felt as though there really were something coming out of him, and smiled with pleasure. 'It's a good thing,' said the tailor. 'Please God, it will do you good.' The Jew put on twelve cups and then another twelve, drank some tea, and went away. Nikolay began shivering; his face looked drawn, and, as the women expressed it, shrank up like a fist; his fingers turned blue. He wrapped himself up in a quilt and in a sheepskin, but got colder and colder. Towards the evening he began to be in great distress; asked to be laid on the ground, asked the tailor not to smoke; then he subsided under the sheepskin and towards morning he died. IX Oh, what a grim, what a long winter! Their own grain did not last beyond Christmas, and they had to buy flour. Kiryak, who lived at home now, was noisy in the evenings, inspiring terror in everyone, and in the mornings he suffered from headache and was ashamed; and he was a pitiful sight. In the stall the starved cows bellowed day and night -- a heart-rending sound to Granny and Marya. And as ill-luck would have it, there was a sharp frost all the winter, the snow drifted in high heaps, and the winter dragged on. At Annunciation there was a regular blizzard, and there was a fall of snow at Easter. But in spite of it all the winter did end. At the beginning of April there came warm days and frosty nights. Winter would not give way, but one warm day overpowered it at last, and the streams began to flow and the birds began to sing. The whole meadow and the bushes near the river were drowned in the spring floods, and all the space between Zhukovo and the further side was filled up with a vast sheet of water, from which wild ducks rose up in flocks here and there. The spring sunset, flaming among gorgeous clouds, gave every evening something new, extraordinary, incredible -- just what one does not believe in afterwards, when one sees those very colours and those very clouds in a picture. The cranes flew swiftly, swiftly, with mournful cries, as though they were calling themselves. Standing on the edge of the ravine, Olga looked a long time at the flooded meadow, at the sunshine, at the bright church, that looked as though it had grown younger; and her tears flowed and her breath came in gasps from her passionate longing to go away, to go far away to the end of the world. It was already settled that she should go back to Moscow to be a servant, and that Kiryak should set off with her to get a job as a porter or something. Oh, to get away quickly! As soon as it dried up and grew warm they got ready to set off. Olga and Sasha, with wallets on their backs and shoes of plaited bark on their feet, came out before daybreak: Marya came out, too, to see them on their way. Kiryak was not well, and was kept at home for another week. For the last time Olga prayed at the church and thought of her husband, and though she did not shed tears, her face puckered up and looked ugly like an old woman's. During the winter she had grown thinner and plainer, and her hair had gone a little grey, and instead of the old look of sweetness and the pleasant smile on her face, she had the resigned, mournful expression left by the sorrows she had been through, and there was something blank and irresponsive in her eyes, as though she did not hear what was said. She was sorry to part from the village and the peasants. She remembered how they had carried out Nikolay, and how a requiem had been ordered for him at almost every hut, and all had shed tears in sympathy with her grief. In the course of the summer and the winter there had been hours and days when it seemed as though these people lived worse than the beasts, and to live with them was terrible; they were coarse, dishonest, filthy, and drunken; they did not live in harmony, but quarrelled continually, because they distrusted and feared and did not respect one another. Who keeps the tavern and makes the people drunken? A peasant. Who wastes and spends on drink the funds of the commune, of the schools, of the church? A peasant. Who stole from his neighbours, set fire to their property, gave false witness at the court for a bottle of vodka? At the meetings of the Zemstvo and other local bodies, who was the first to fall foul of the peasants? A peasant. Yes, to live with them was terrible; but yet, they were human beings, they suffered and wept like human beings, and there was nothing in their lives for which one could not find excuse. Hard labour that made the whole body ache at night, the cruel winters, the scanty harvests, the overcrowding; and they had no help and none to whom they could look for help. Those of them who were a little stronger and better off could be no help, as they were themselves coarse, dishonest, drunken, and abused one another just as revoltingly; the paltriest little clerk or official treated the peasants as though they were tramps, and addressed even the village elders and church wardens as inferiors, and considered they had a right to do so. And, indeed, can any sort of help or good example be given by mercenary, greedy, depraved, and idle persons who only visit the village in order to insult, to despoil, and to terrorize? Olga remembered the pitiful, humiliated look of the old people when in the winter Kiryak had been taken to be flogged. . . . And now she felt sorry for all these people, painfully so, and as she walked on she kept looking back at the huts. After walking two miles with them Marya said good-bye, then kneeling, and falling forward with her face on the earth, she began wailing: 'Again I am left alone. Alas, for poor me! poor, unhappy! . . .' And she wailed like this for a long time, and for a long way Olga and Sasha could still see her on her knees, bowing down to someone at the side and clutching her head in her hands, while the rooks flew over her head. The sun rose high; it began to get hot. Zhukovo was left far behind. Walking was pleasant. Olga and Sasha soon forgot both the village and Marya; they were gay and everything entertained them. Now they came upon an ancient barrow, now upon a row of telegraph posts running one after another into the distance and disappearing into the horizon, and the wires hummed mysteriously. Then they saw a homestead, all wreathed in green foliage; there came a scent from it of dampness, of hemp, and it seemed for some reason that happy people lived there. Then they came upon a horse's skeleton whitening in solitude in the open fields. And the larks trilled unceasingly, the corncrakes called to one another, and the landrail cried as though someone were really scraping at an old iron rail. At midday Olga and Sasha reached a big village. There in the broad street they met the little old man who was General Zhukov's cook. He was hot, and his red, perspiring bald head shone in the sunshine. Olga and he did not recognize each other, then looked round at the same moment, recognized each other, and went their separate ways without saying a word. Stopping near the hut which looked newest and most prosperous, Olga bowed down before the open windows, and said in a loud, thin, chanting voice: 'Good Christian folk, give alms, for Christ's sake, that God's blessing may be upon you, and that your parents may be in the Kingdom of Heaven in peace eternal.' 'Good Christian folk,' Sasha began chanting, 'give, for Christ's sake, that God's blessing, the Heavenly Kingdom . . .'

       " \"                                   Better days.   I feel good.  I feel a whole lot better these days.  I finally got my computer back into working order and I've been getting a lot of work done.  Actually, I think I've been so excited to get my computer back that I've been doing too much, and not focusing on finishing just  one  thing.  In the last week, I've been finishing my website, teaching myself Macromedia Flash and Fireworks and trying to write like 10 things at once.  Both programs I've been learning look like they'll be a boon to my productivity and that will let me do my websites a whole lot better.  And sometime in the next few months I will prolly do some short animated movies with flash.  But in the mean time, instead of getting stuff finished like I was hoping (and was actually well on my way to doing)  I've let myself get distracted with a thousand different things.  I can say that in the next few months I will be able to finish my entire website the way I was wanting to.  I have no doubt of that.  It just might take another week or so for me to settle back into a routine of having my  own  computer.  Something funny that I've noticed lately... I was able to write better on my Dad's computer.  Haha.  Imagine that.  I don't know what it is, maybe that the room is so dark and cramped, that there's no distraction.  Just writing.  Or maybe the way the keyboard  'clik-claks'  loudly.  My keyboard is all soft and quiet.  No noises.  I think part of me misses the enthusiasm that goes along with the sound of chattering keys.  Anyways, I just thought that was interesting.  I might actually continue to use his computer, just to keep up my productivity.    In other news, I had THE BEST massage yesterday.  God it's been years since I've had a massage, and this one was great.  I just thought I'd share that.

       " \"                                   Full moon.   The moon is full.  You can tell by the way that everything has subtilely changed.  It was a good night.  Things changed tonight.  Lots of things in me have changed tonight.  But the change was bigger than anytime that I can remember.  It was a night full of epiphanies and discoveries and honest introspection.  I discovered discipline,  true  discipline, not the fairweather dedication I've been practicing.  I've known for a long time that I don't do near as much work as I can handle.  And tonight I realized that the work I do do is only to keep a balance.  I draw enough to keep stuff on the website, just to keep my traffic coming in.  And I write enough on here so that there's a reason for people to come back again.  But I don't do anything unless there is a requirement for me to do so.  This is where my lack of discipline comes from.  I don't make commitments to do work, because I am a man of my word and if I  give  my word to work then it becomes something I 'have' to do.  So I've gotten really good at not having any commitments.  I don't have many financial commitments anymore or for that matter hardly any reason for me to get out of bed.  I work, and am reasonably productive, but nowhere near where I could be and used to be.  This is not the way for me to succede.    So my realization is that I  need  to make commitments.  I need to 'have' to do things, because that leads to discipline and routine.  And that is what is sorely lacking in my life right now.  So starting next weekend I'm going to start doing caricatures again.  On top of my regular art chores.  First few weeks at the flea market, then Old Mill trade days then possibly the mall.  But it's a 'have' to do thing now.  I have to do it every weekend.  And after a few weeks it will become routine.  I've discovered that the route of successful discipline is found in creating order.  But not in the way I always thought it was.  The order comes first, meaning everything needs it's place.  But the discipline comes from 'requiring of yourself' to put everything back in order after you are done.  This goes with  tasks  as well.  The task has to be put in order before you move onto the next.  This is the route of discipline.    I know this all sounds so basic... so simple.  But tonight, to me, it was a brilliant realization.  I have this amazing ability to adapt and 'put up' with a lot.  Right now I am so committed to my career that I live in abject poverty.  I tell myself I'm only suffering so that I can focus on my work.  But I know that's a load of crap because I don't do near as much work now as when I had a lot of other things required of me.  But I put up with it because I can get away with it.  Because doing better lately has not been 'required' of me.  Ever since I closed the studio I have accepted lower standards for myself.  It may have much to do with dealing with the rejection that came along with that.  But I can't use that as an excuse any longer.  I don't do hardly anything, simply because I don't have to.  The problem is that I am unchallenged.  And staying unchallenged for a long amount of time, leads to depression from lack of pride of self.  Suddenly being able to put up with crap is not the amazing talent I once though it was.  Suddenly working a 9 - 5 has a method to it's madness.  Suddenly being productive and disciplined has a whole new meaning to me.  So we'll see in the next few weeks how these new found ideas are put into action.   --Will                  \",\n",

Cold water fish and flax, sources of omega-3 fatty acids, may slow tumor  growth and reduce the spreading capability of cancer cells. For example, salmon  oil has effectively killed human cervical cancer cells in test tube studies.     High-fiber cereal grains contribute fiber and phytates, which help to   remove excess circulating estrogen  from the body and provides cell  protecting antioxidants, respectively.

My boots are worn Through the soul, Yet my feet are tough, And my mind is whole.  The stench of death Runs down the road, But my eyes stay straight; My spirit stays bold.  I cannot die, For my will is too strong, My mind is too sharp, My life will be long.  I will see my homes again: The Southern sands, The northern mountains, For I protect those lands.  I stride with the confidence That I am far away From that aged field Where my deathbed lay.  I will not die in this war; My life is too great. I will change the world Before I meet my fate.  With this confidence,  My battles are won; My heroism shines; My medals are hung Back in my tent For another time, Another life, Another design.  For now there is duty That must be done; Victories to be had; Battles to be won.  March, march, march, Has led us to the field Where our valor is shown In the weapons we wield.  The enemy is here, Weak and scared, Our guns are fired. Their ranks are marred.  I laugh at them, Defying my death. As their bullets fly, One enters my breast.  A mistake has been made;  I fire to rectify The fool it was  That let it fly.  My breath is short, Cut small into gasps That spit up blood Along with my rasps.  It will not be; My day has not come, Yet I can feel the darkness Begin to overcome The will I had When the war had begun. I lie on my back; And can’t see the sun..  “No!” I scream. I will not die here. I will not give in To this cadaver’s fear.  “My life is not spent!” I yell. As I rise from the ground, I hear the victory shouts-- What a beautiful sound.  Later that night, In victory’s camp, I lie back waiting For my breath to revamp.  I look to the doctor, Yet no time can be spared For an able soldier With breathing impaired, Whose limbs are still strong, And trigger finger quick-- For many are dying, And many are sick.  There are legs to be severed, And bones to be set; Cuts to be bandaged, And makers to be met.  And in all the turmoil, I am transparent, With which my unwelcome Is made apparent.  I cannot feel my breath; My lungs feel halted; My chest seems still; Yet my senses must be faulted, For still my mind works, And my legs do their purpose, For my life is too important For ailments to surface.  I see a man crying, I ask what he’s lost; He says, “why must war Have such great cost? Cause so much death, And pervert so many living? Why can’t men find peace, Joy, and thanksgiving?” “Because men are human” I say with a smile. “There will always be that which is vile.. Which we must destroy-- To preserve our world And keep our homes Safely curled, Away from the destruction That would destroy the race And take the beauty of humans From the planet’s face.” But the man keeps crying As if he had not heard, Or thought the reasons I’d given Were purely absurd.  So I move on past the man With my victorious mood-- Off to the mess To acquire some food, For inside I am empty, That I cam feel, And I need the comfort Of a good, hearty meal.  As I sit at the table, Behind potatoes, and meat, Corn, and green beans, And Cake as a treat, Behind baskets of rolls, And puddings, and pies, A whole plate of cookies, Yet all of them are lies. For as I bite into the meat, The flesh turns to soil; The potatoes to manure; The green beans are spoiled.  My emptiness roared As my bare stomach wrenched; My mind filled with fury, As my fists fly clenched, At the table of plenty And the food flies off the table Onto the ground, Around men who were able To enjoy the meal. Without convulsing in pain At the feel of food for the living On the tongue of life’s bane.  I did not feel my heart, Yet it could not be true-- My life was too vital, So I flew from the room.  I am running far Without breath or weary; Without the feel of the wind, And the burn of muscle searing.  I run through the night, And with the first light, I find the harbor That would aid my plight, For it held the ship That could bear me home, Where I could assuage my fears And not be alone.  The ship is called sorrow; Which is aptly named, For it bears the souls That death has claimed.  I wandered the ship, Whose job was to ferry The unlucky ones home To sadly be buried.  At the end of my voyage, As I roamed through the hold, I came upon a box That added fear to my cold.  The box held markings That I was sure I knew, Yet I seemed to have forgotten For my memories are few.  As I stared at the letters Carved into the wood, The meaning came suddenly And I understood.  The words were clear: Robert M. James. I ran because It was my earthly name.  Over the side of Sorrow,  I do not care If what I run on is nothing but air. I have to find The one who would know What had happened, why my reflection wouldn’t show.  When I reached my home, I ran to my girl-- She sat in a chair With letter unfurled. It read from my commander Who had to have lied. For it gave the message That in battle I had died. I try to lift The tears from her face, Or feel my love In her embrace. But the tears still flow; my embrace was cold my hands aren’t there And my time is getting old.  I look at the face Of my darling wife. And can feel the tether break That ties me to life.  My spirit is failing I have nothing left. My mind is finished Deceiving death.                ',\n",

Brian played guitar for awhile and learned some new Cradle of Filth songs within like 3 minutes! He seriously is amazing. I can't believe how fast he picks up things. Wow! Then we went to my house and got Jack in the Box which we had to wait for like 15 minutes all for it to suck ass. They didn't even give sweet and sour sauce for our eggrolls! What buttheads! So we started watching Halloween again, because the first time we watched it we both fell asleep, but then didn't get to finish it because Brian had to go. Then tomorrow we have to mow, and Alex wants to have practice since it's his day off. The problem is, we mow around 6pm and don't get done until 8pm and by then we are tired and don't want to do anything...so I don't know what we are going to do about that.

Then one side of my door will be white (the outside that faces the hall) and the inside of my door will be black. Then I want to get a new desk that is more modern style and black, and then I have this little table thats kind of like an altar and I want to get a nice cover for it that is black with silver stars on it. Then I'm going to get an area rug thats fuzzy and black that covers this crappy tile. Then I want a canopy to go over my bed and black curtains. I'll have a black comforter and I don't think I like white throw pillows, so the whole bed just might be black or I could get purple or red ones even though it doesn't really go, but so what. Then I want to get this little butterfly chair thats black and fuzzy and then an ottoman thats checkered black and white and it opens and you can store stuff in it!! And I want a nice mirror and this cute silver clock. So yes, I need that job at Wal-mart rather desperatly now.                  \",\n",

       " \"                                  BOOTSTRAP PROTOCOL (BOOTP)   1. Status of this Memo   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.Distribution of this memo is unlimited.   2. Overview   This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and executed.  The bootstrap operation can be thought of as consisting of TWO PHASES. This RFC describes the first phase, which could be labeled 'address determination and bootfile selection'.  After this address and filename information is obtained, control passes to the second phase of the bootstrap where a file transfer occurs.  The file transfer will typically use the TFTP protocol [9], since it is intended that both phases reside in PROM on the client.However BOOTP could also work with other protocols such as SFTP [3] or FTP [6].  We suggest that the client's PROM software provide a way to do a complete bootstrap without 'user' interaction.  This is the type of boot that would occur during an unattended power-up.  A mechanism should be provided for the user to manually supply the necessary address and filename information to bypass the BOOTP protocol and enter the file transfer phase directly.  If non-volatile storage is available, we suggest keeping default settings there and bypassing the BOOTP protocol unless these settings cause the file transfer phase to fail.  If the cached information fails, the bootstrap should fall back to phase 1 and use BOOTP.   Here is a brief outline of the protocol:   1. A single packet exchange is performed.  Timeouts are used to retransmit until a reply is received.  The same packet field layout is used in both directions.  Fixed length fields of maximum reasonable length are used to simplify structure definition and parsing.  2. An 'opcode' field exists with two values.  The client broadcasts a 'bootrequest' packet.  The server then answers with a 'bootreply' packet.  The bootrequest contains the client's hardware address and its IP address, if known.  3. The request can optionally contain the name of the server the client wishes to respond.  This is so the client can force the boot to occur from a specific host (e.g. if multiple versions of the same bootfile exist or if the server is in a far distant net/domain).  The client does not have to deal with name / domain services; instead this function is pushed off to the BOOTP server.  4. The request can optionally contain the 'generic' filename to be booted.  For example 'unix' or 'ethertip'.  When the server sends the bootreply, it replaces this field with the fully qualified path name of the appropriate boot file.  In determining this name, the server may consult his own database correlating the client's address and filename request, with a particular boot file customized for that client.  If the bootrequest filename is a null string, then the server returns a filename field indicating the 'default' file to be loaded for that client.  5. In the case of clients who do not know their IP addresses, the server must also have a database relating hardware address to IP address.  This client IP address is then placed into a field in the bootreply.  6. Certain network topologies (such as Stanford's) may be such that a given physical cable does not have a TFTP server directly attached to it (e.g. all the gateways and hosts on a certain cable may be diskless).  With the cooperation of neighboring gateways, BOOTP can allow clients to boot off of servers several hops away, through these gateways.  See the section 'Booting Through Gateways' below.  This part of the protocol requires no special action on the part of the client.  Implementation is optional and requires a small amount of additional code in gateways and servers.   3. Packet Format   All numbers shown are decimal, unless indicated otherwise.  The BOOTP packet is enclosed in a standard IP [8] UDP [7] datagram.  For simplicity it is assumed that the BOOTP packet is never fragmented.Any numeric fields shown are packed in 'standard network byte order',i.e. high order bits are sent first.  In the IP header of a bootrequest, the client fills in its own IP source address if known, otherwise zero.  When the server address is unknown, the IP destination address will be the 'broadcast ad dress'255.255.255.255.  This address means 'broadcast on the local cable,(I don't know my net number)' [4].  The UDP header contains source and destination port numbers.  The BOOTP protocol uses two reserved port numbers, 'BOOTP client' (68) and 'BOOTP server' (67).  The client sends requests using 'BOOTP server' as the destination port; this is usually a broadcast.  The server sends replies using 'BOOTP client' as the destination port; depending on the kernel or driver facilities in the server, this may or may not be a broadcast (this is explained further in the section itled 'Chicken/Egg issues' below).  The reason TWO reserved ports are used, is to avoid 'waking up' and scheduling the BOOTP server daemons, when a bootreply must be broadcast to a client.Since the server and other hosts won't be listening on the 'BOOTP client' port,any such incoming broadcasts will be filtered out at the kernel level.  We could not simply allow the client to pick a 'random' port number for the UDP source port field; since the server reply may be broadcast, a randomly chosen port number could confuse other hosts that happened to be listening on that port.  The UDP length field is set to the length of the UDP plus BOOTP portions of the packet.  The UDP checksum field can be set to zero by the client (or server) if desired, to avoid this extra overhead in a PROM implementation.  In the 'Packet Processing' section below the phrase '[UDP checksum.]' is used whenever the checksum might be verified/computed.

This info may be set aside for use                          by a third phase bootstrap or kernel.   4. Chicken / Egg Issues   How can the server send an IP datagram to the client, if the client doesnt know its own IP address (yet)?  Whenever a bootreply is being  sent, the transmitting machine performs the following operations:        1. If the client knows its own IP address ('ciaddr' field is       nonzero), then the IP can be sent 'as normal', since the client will respond to ARPs [5].        2. If the client does not yet know its IP address (ciaddr zero),then the client cannot respond to ARPs sent by the transmitter of the bootreply.  There are two options:           a. If the transmitter has the necessary kernel or driver hooks RFC 951 to 'manually' construct an ARP address cache entry, then it can fill in an entry using the 'chaddr' and 'yiaddr' fields.  Of course, this entry should have a timeout on it, just like any other entry made by the normal ARP code itself.  The          transmitter of the bootreply can then simply send the bootreply          to the client's IP address.  UNIX (4.2 BSD) has this          capability.           b. If the transmitter lacks these kernel hooks, it can simply          send the bootreply to the IP broadcast address on the          appropriate interface.  This is only one additional broadcast          over the previous case.   5. Client Use of ARP      The client PROM must contain a simple implementation of ARP, e.g. the    address cache could be just one entry in size.  This will allow a    second-phase-only boot (TFTP) to be performed when the client knows    the IP addresses and bootfile name.     Any time the client is expecting to receive a TFTP or BOOTP reply, it    should be prepared to answer an ARP request for its own IP to    hardware address mapping (if known).     Since the bootreply will contain (in the hardware encapsulation) the    hardware source address of the server/gateway, the client MAY be able    to avoid sending an ARP request for the server/gateway IP address to    be used in the following TFTP phase.  However this should be treated    only as a special case, since it is desirable to still allow a    second-phase-only boot as described above.   6. Comparison to RARP      An earlier protocol, Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) [1]    was proposed to allow a client to determine its IP address, given    that it knew its hardware address.  However RARP had the disadvantage    that it was a hardware link level protocol (not IP/UDP based).  This    means that RARP could only be implemented on hosts containing special    kernel or driver modifications to access these 'raw' packets.  Since    there are many network kernels existent now, with each source    maintained by different organizations, a boot protocol that does not    require kernel modifications is a decided advantage.     BOOTP provides this hardware to IP address lookup function, in    addition to the other useful features described in the sections    above.  RFC 951                                                   September 1985 Bootstrap Protocol   7. Packet Processing      7.1. Client Transmission        Before setting up the packet for the first time, it is a good idea to clear the entire packet buffer to all zeros; this will place all fields in their default state.  The client then creates a packet with the following fields.        The IP destination address is set to 255.255.255.255.  (the       broadcast address) or to the server's IP address (if known).  The IP source address and 'ciaddr' are set to the client's IP address if known, else 0.  The UDP header is set with the proper length;source port = 'BOOTP client' port destination port = 'BOOTP server' port.        'op' is set to '1', BOOTREQUEST.  'htype' is set to the hardware address type as assigned in the ARP section of the 'Assigned Numbers' RFC. 'hlen' is set to the length of the hardware address, e.g. '6' for 10mb ethernet.        'xid' is set to a 'random' transaction id.  'secs' is set to the number of seconds that have elapsed since the client has started booting.  This will let the servers know how long a client has been trying.  As the number gets larger, certain servers may feel more 'sympathetic' towards a client they don't normally service.       If a client lacks a suitable clock, it could construct a rough estimate using a loop timer.  Or it could choose to simply send this field as always a fixed value, say 100 seconds.        If the client knows its IP address, 'ciaddr' (and the IP source address) are set to this value.  'chaddr' is filled in with the client's hardware address.        If the client wishes to restrict booting to a particular server name, it may place a null-terminated string in 'sname'.  The name used should be any of the allowable names or nicknames of the desired host.        The client has several options for filling the 'file' name field.If left null, the meaning is 'I want to boot the default file for my machine'.  A null file name can also mean 'I am only interested in finding out client/server/gateway IP addresses, I dont care about file names'.        The field can also be a 'generic' name such as 'unix' or  RFC 951                                                   September 1985 Bootstrap Protocol        'gateway'; this means 'boot the named program configured for my machine'.  Finally the field can be a fully directory qualified path name.        The 'vend' field can be filled in by the client with vendor-specific strings or structures.  For example the machine hardware type or serial number may be placed here.  However the operation of the BOOTP server should not DEPEND on this information existing.        If the 'vend' field is used, it is recommended that a 4 byte 'magic number' be the first item within 'vend'.  This lets a server determine what kind of information it is seeing in this field.  Numbers can be assigned by the usual 'magic number' process --you pick one and it's magic.  A different magic number could be used for bootreply's than bootrequest's to allow the client to take special action with the reply information. [UDP checksum.]     7.2. Client Retransmission Strategy        If no reply is received for a certain length of time, the client should retransmit the request.  The time interval must be chosen carefully so as not to flood the network.  Consider the case of a cable containing 100 machines that are just coming up after a power failure.  Simply retransmitting the request every four seconds will inundate the net.        As a possible strategy, you might consider backing off       exponentially, similar to the way ethernet backs off on a       collision.  So for example if the first packet is at time 0:00,the second would be at :04, then :08, then :16, then :32, then :64.  You should also randomize each time; this would be done similar to the ethernet specification by starting with a mask and 'and'ing that with with a random number to get the first backoff. On each succeeding backoff, the mask is increased in length by one bit.This doubles the average delay on each backoff.        After the 'average' backoff reaches about 60 seconds, it should be increased no further, but still randomized.        Before each retransmission, the client should update the 'secs'field. [UDP checksum.]  RFC 951                                                   September 1985 Bootstrap Protocol  7.3. Server Receives BOOTREQUEST  [UDP checksum.]  If the UDP destination port does not match the 'BOOTP server' port, discard the packet.        If the server name field (sname) is null (no particular server specified), or sname is specified and matches our name or nickname, then continue with packet processing.        If the sname field is specified, but does not match 'us', then there are several options:           1. You may choose to simply discard this packet.           2. If a name lookup on sname shows it to be on this same cable,discard the packet.           3. If sname is on a different net, you may choose to forward the packet to that address.  If so, check the 'giaddr' (gateway address) field.  If 'giaddr' is zero, fill it in with my          address or the address of a gateway that can be used to get to that net.  Then forward the packet.        If the client IP address (ciaddr) is zero, then the client does not know its own IP address.  Attempt to lookup the client hardware address (chaddr, hlen, htype) in our database.  If no match is found, discard the packet.  Otherwise we now have an IP address for this client; fill it into the 'yiaddr' (your IP address) field.        We now check the boot file name field (file).  The field will be null if the client is not interested in filenames, or wants the default bootfile.  If the field is non-null, it is used as a lookup key in a database, along with the client's IP address.  If there is a default file or generic file (possibly indexed by the client address) or a fully-specified path name that matches, then replace the 'file' field with the fully-specified path name of the selected boot file.  If the field is non-null and no match was found, then the client is asking for a file we dont have; discard the packet, perhaps some other BOOTP server will have it.The 'vend' vendor-specific data field should now be checked and if a recognized type of data is provided, client-specific actions should be taken, and a response placed in the 'vend' data field of the reply packet.  For example, a workstation client could provide   RFC 951                                                   September 1985 Bootstrap Protocol        an authentication key and receive from the server a capability for remote file access, or a set of configuration options, which can be passed to the operating system that will shortly be booted in.        Place my (server) IP address in the 'siaddr' field.  Set the 'op'field to BOOTREPLY.  The UDP destination port is set to 'BOOTP client'.  If the client address 'ciaddr' is nonzero, send the packet there; else if the gateway address 'giaddr' is nonzero, set the UDP destination port to 'BOOTP server' and send the packet to'giaddr'; else the client is on one of our cables but it doesnt know its own IP address yet --use a method described in the 'Egg'  section above to send it to the client. If 'Egg' is used and we have multiple interfaces on this host, use the 'yiaddr' (your IP address) field to figure out which net (cable/interface) to send the packet to.  [UDP checksum.]     7.4. Server/Gateway Receives BOOTREPLY        [UDP checksum.]  If 'yiaddr' (your [the client's] IP address)refers to one of our cables, use one of the 'Egg' methods above toforward it to the client.  Be sure to send it to the 'BOOTP client' UDP destination port.     7.5. Client Reception        Don't forget to process ARP requests for my own IP address (if I know it).  [UDP checksum.]  The client should discard incoming packets that: are not IP/UDPs addressed to the boot port; are not BOOTREPLYs; do not match my IP address (if I know it) or myhardware address; do not match my transaction id.  Otherwise  we       have received a successful reply. 'yiaddr' will contain my IP address, if I didnt know it before.  'file' is the name of the file name to TFTP 'read request'.  The server address is in 'siaddr'.  If 'giaddr' (gateway address) is nonzero, then the packets should be forwarded there first, in order to get to the server.   8. Booting Through Gateways     This part of the protocol is optional and requires some additional code in cooperating gateways and servers, but it allows cross-gateway booting.  This is mainly useful when gateways are diskless machines.Gateways containing disks (e.g. a UNIX machine acting as a gateway),might as well run their own BOOTP/TFTP servers.     Gateways listening to broadcast BOOTREQUESTs may decide to forward or rebroadcast these requests 'when appropriate'.  For example, the  RFC 951                                                   September 1985 Bootstrap Protocol     gateway could have, as part of his configuration tables, a list of other networks or hosts to receive a copy of any broadcast BOOTREQUESTs.  Even though a 'hops' field exists, it is a poor ideato simply globally rebroadcast the requests, since broadcast loops will almost certainly occur.     The forwarding could begin immediately, or wait until the 'secs'(seconds client has been trying) field passes a certain threshold.     If a gateway does decide to forward the request, it should look at the 'giaddr' (gateway IP address) field.  If zero, it should plug its own IP address (on the receiving cable) into this field.  It may also use the 'hops' field to optionally control how far the packet is reforwarded. Hops should be incremented on each forwarding.  For example, if hops passes '3', the packet should probably be discarded.[UDP checksum.]     Here we have recommended placing this special forwarding function in the gateways.  But that does not have to be the case.  As long as some 'BOOTP forwarding agent' exists on the net with the booting client, the agent can do the forwarding when appropriate.  Thus this service may or may not be co-located with the gateway.  In the case of a forwarding agent not located in the gateway, the agent could save himself some work by plugging the broadcast address of the interface receiving the bootrequest into the 'giaddr' field.Thus the reply would get forwarded using normal gateways, not involving the forwarding agent.  Of course the disadvantage here is that you lose the ability to use the 'Egg' non-broadcast method of sending the reply, causing extra overhead for every host on the client cable.   9. Sample BOOTP Server Database      As a suggestion, we show a sample text file database that the BOOTP server program might use.  The database has two sections, delimited by a line containing an percent in column 1.  The first section contains a 'default directory' and mappings from generic names to directory/pathnames.  The first generic name in this section is the 'default file' you get when the bootrequest contains a null 'file'string.     The second section maps hardware addresstype/address into an    ipaddress. Optionally you can also overide the default generic nameby supplying a ipaddress specific genericname.  A 'suffix' item is also an option; if supplied, any generic names specified by the client will be accessed by first appending 'suffix' to the 'pathname'  RFC 951                                                   September 1985 Bootstrap Protocol  appropriate to that generic name.  If that file is not found, then the plain 'pathname' will be tried.  This 'suffix' option allows a whole set of custom generics to be setup without a lot of effort.

       " '                                  Its 8a.m. and you’re sitting in the health clinic waiting for the results of your HIV test—alone! You’re worried about your health, your future and your livelihood—alone! But, in all fairness, you and you alone are to blame.      If you haven’t heard about the myriad of sexually transmitted diseases (some transferable without the actual act of sex, like oral herpes which can be transmitted through kissing) or know at least one person who regrets having children, then surely, you’ve been living under a rock. Everyday, be it at school, work or home, we see, hear, or read something new about the rise in HIV infection or soaring abortion rates among teens. Perhaps you’ve seen a billboard, read a pamphlet or overheard a conversation about abstinence, unwanted pregnancy or STD’s. Maybe you were watching TV and have seen or heard some innuendo about sex. Sex, it seems, is all around us. And even though everything you’ve heard about sex may not be particularly negative, I can say with some certainty that alarming and controversial information about sex is around us hovering, like a thick fog, everyday. I, of course, could be wrong, and if by some chance you haven’t heard anything about the risks of unprotected sex or just plain-old sex for that matter, its time to do some research.  Even with the prevalence and availability of information about the perils of unprotected sex, many of us are still doing the deed without any protection or method of contraception. This, however, is no phenomenon and I am prepared to offer a theory: Perhaps we aren’t asking ourselves some poignant questions before getting hot and heavy. Has sex become such a trivial matter that we are neglecting to do a little soul-searching before it initiates? I certainly don’t have all the answers, but I have come up with some important questions…  1.  AM I ASSERTIVE ENOUGH TO PROTECT MYSELF?   Imagine you and your partner are at the moment where you are just about to have sex. Libidos are up and clothes are off but the condom issue never comes up. Just then, it occurs to you: if something isn’t said within the next five seconds, you’ll be engaged in unprotected sex. Are you confident enough to bring it up? Or would you rather not spoil the mood/ embarrass yourself/ offend the other party? If you’ve ever been in this situation and were hesitant about being assertive about protection, then you may have a problem.  Unfortunately, many of us, young and old, have been in this situation and did not have enough guts to speak up about protecting ourselves. However, there is an easy solution and I’ll put it bluntly: If you are comfortable enough with yourself and your partner to share yourself with him or her, then you should be comfortable enough to ask about protection. This can be as simple as saying, “Shouldn’t we be using a condom?” or “Are you forgetting something?” Worried about your partner’s response? Don’t be-after stating you want to have protected sex assertively and confidently, the need for a snappy rebuttal in the event of a refusal is useless. If your partner is unwilling to use a condom, then what should come to mind might be the following: “How many other partners has he had unprotected sex with?” “How can she not care enough to protect herself from the inevitable?” Most importantly, before having sex, try asking yourself, “Am I assertive enough to insist on having protected sex?”  2.  DO I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONAL IMPLICATIONS?   I’m sure we have all heard of casual sex or maybe are friends with a “ho” or “player” (or, dare I say, may even be a “ho” or “player”). Since promiscuity is not at all unheard of, I think it’s probably safe to say we all have at least some familiarity with the concept. I, myself, know lots of men who love the idea of casual sex and purposely go to clubs, bars, picnics-anywhere women are, specifically looking for a one-night-stand. However, the women I know who love the idea have a different perspective about sex without commitment. For them, sex may just be a means to gain all the money, cars, jewelry and clothes their hearts desire. The idea is appealing on the surface because everyone is getting what he or she wants, right? But how many people think about the emotional implications of this so-called casual sex?  This adage is old but true: “There is no such thing as casual sex.” Sadly enough, most people don’t find any truth in this saying until they, ahem, take a stab at it. Again, I could be wrong, maybe some people can completely emotionally detach themselves from sex. However, after some deep probing with players, men and women alike, I get the idea that something is either left behind (respect, dignity) or taken along (regret or a nagging curiosity about a complete stranger) when these casual encounters begin to pile up. Take Tracie, who when her heart was broken at the tender age of fifteen, vowed to never get emotionally attached to another man again. Tracie quickly became a master of conning men into giving her whatever she wanted but realized, after years of playing men for money, that she’d gained nothing she couldn’t get on her own. “Lots of girls were jealous of me” says Tracie, “and I thought I really had it going on, but when I saw that I was alone, insecure and had no marketable skills to get a well-paying job, I felt stupid…And I regret to say this, but I felt like I had prostituted myself for nothing.” Now Tracie is going to college, while trying to heal deep-rooted emotional scars, regret, a loss of self-respect and cope with a syphilis diagnosis. “If I knew then what I know now,” she begins, “I would have never been the player I was…life is too short for that. I could have been married now or at least had a steady boyfriend-someone who cares about me, you know?” Tracie had devised detailed schemes, had everything figured out and was good at what she did, but neglected to consider her  own  feelings. But we can all take a lesson from Tracie by asking ourselves, “Am I ready for/do I understand the emotional implications of sex?” before rolling in the hay.  3.  DO I UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES (OR EVEN BELIEVE THEY EXIST)?   Chances are, you know someone who’s contracted a sexually transmitted disease. A recent report from the Hendrick Health System reports that  “ one in four sexually active Americans will be affected by an STD at some time in his or her life.” In addition, twenty-five percent of these infected people are between the ages of sixteen and nineteen. While some were “lucky” enough to contract something that was curable, for example, chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis, some were unfortunate enough to contract genital herpes, genital warts or HIV. Whatever the case, I guarantee you that this person would have never imagined it could have happened to him or her. Still, so many of people believe that they can look at someone and determine whether he or she has an STD based on appearance, demeanor, style, acquaintances, whatever. Even though common sense tells us that it is, in fact, impossible to look at someone and make a medical diagnosis, some people still continue to play this game of sexual Russian roulette, but why?  I firmly believe that people who think, albeit sometimes half-heartedly, that they can make medical diagnosis, without any medical tests, based on assumptions alone, really believe that they could never actually contract a sexually transmitted disease. I have no anecdotes for these types of people, nor can I give any examples or scenarios which could be extremely helpful; I can only plead with them to use a ounce of sound judgment and declare that they’d rather be safe than sorry, for those who have contracted an STD are truly sorry. If you are not worried about an STD, perhaps the loss of your freedom is a little more important. Simply put, once you become a parent, the freedom to think only about yourself is gone. You are immediately responsible for another human-being’s life. Children cost money and time, require constant care, and deserve to be born to responsible, caring parents. No one “asks” to be born and to have a child and be ill-prepared (financially and emotionally) is unfair to everyone involved. Similarly, there are options to “take care” of an unwanted pregnancy, but abortion and adoption are heavy emotional burdens to carry and because these burdens are emotional, they are not easily forgotten or resolved. Basically, try asking yourself (and being honest with the answer), “Do I understand the consequences of sex and truly believe they exist?”  This article began with a presumably hypothetical situation that is, unfortunately, played-out everyday, several times a day, across the nation. An ashamed, perhaps confused young woman (or man) walks into a clinic to be tested for HIV. A sample is taken, a number is assigned to the sample and she’s given a card with the same number to identify herself when she returns a week later for her results. During that week, she’s worried and replays scenes in her mind rethinking what she could have and should have done. She thinks about all her partners and reevaluates them, perhaps coming to terms with the fact that one of these young men could have infected her with HIV. A week later, she walks herself back into the clinic, her heart is racing and her head is pounding. It’s her turn-she’s HIV-positive. She’s seventeen, preparing to go on her prom and now, preparing to die. Instead of asking herself these questions  before  she had sex, she is now asking herself one of the most perplexing and redundant questions of all-“Why me?”  The point is: you and you alone are responsible for your emotional and physical health. Asking yourself any one of these questions before having sex will prompt you to weigh the pros and cons of the outcome of unprotected, protected, and casual sex. Thinking ahead is the best preventative measure-period. And asking yourself these questions is far more responsible than having condoms and birth-control handy. The sex may last just five minutes, but the outcomes can last a lifetime.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   The Truth about Sex*  HIV/AIDS  Forty million people are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS.

Beautifully shot, very nice acting, compelling story, it had it all. Were there plot points that were messed up? Perhaps. How much of a stickler for detail are you? If you demand perfection, then you've really set yourself up for tremendous disappointment. Otherwise, go, have fun, be scared. But don't go into the woods. Please.         Saturday, out of the blue, I found out I got a raise. WOW! I was completely shocked. And I had just prayed Friday or Saturday morning on the way into work, 'God, I just can't handle having no more money. I can't get out of debt, and I can't even think about doing the other things you're calling me to without any money.' If you're not in debt, stay away from it at any cost. If you're in it, you can commiserate with me. It's a horrible trap.     Watched  Teaching Mrs. Tingle  tonight. Blech. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good, either. Individual parts were good, but combined it was less than the sum of its parts.     I watched  The Talented Mr. Ripley  last week over the course of two or three nights. What a freaky and disturbing movie. Matt Damon was excellent in this, as were Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.     The third disc of 'Rahxephon' came in from Netflix, and I was not horribly happy about it: it had only three episodes on the disc. Why? Disc one had five episodes, and disc two had four episodes. Will disc four have two episodes? I hope not. Anywayz, after watching my three episodes, I was terribly confused, which is not necessarily a difficult thing to do, but all the same, I was still confused. We'll see what happens with the rest of the series to see if it makes sense.                   \",\n",

       " \"                                  MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will begin charging the United States for delivering astronauts and cargo to the international space station starting next year, the head of the Federal Space Agency said Wednesday.          Although Russia and the United States agreed to split the costs of sending men and material to the space station, only Russian spacecraft have been used since last year's space shuttle disaster; space officials say that by carrying the sole burden, Russia has fulfilled its end of the agreement.        'If the Americans want to fly Soyuz (spacecraft) in 2005, they will have to compensate us&nbsp;the costs,' space agency head Anatoly Perminov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.        NASA aims to resume shuttle flights next spring, but efforts to enhance their safety may cause delays.        The European Space Agency is also working on a cargo ship to supplement the U.S. and Russian vessels that fly to the space station.              \",\n",

       " \"                                  Praise the LOOOeeeed      Evrbody    Hello. I'm so excited, I feel like I just accomplished everything I needed to do. It feels like I'm flying on a peppermint patty. I just wanna say that I love my Lord, and I have really been slacking on being one with him. I haven't been praying a lot. I haven't been fasting a lot. I haven't been doing nothing lately. So, I have to get back to the real Good stuff.            THANK YOU JESUS   Guess what, lol ok, maybe you can't guess what.   See I hate that, and I find myself asking those rhetorical questions too. See, I hate when people say hey Tina, guess what, I say um no, I can't guess what. Our they say hey Tina, you know what, I say um no I don't think I do. Or when your friends talk to you and they say for instance( see what I did today was go to school right) and if you talk to me then you know that sometimes I say wrong, because I don't know if it is right or not, after all your the one telling me.                 Since I'm on the subject*********    Don't get me wrong I love everybody. But, I just have to say, that I hate it when one of my white friends at school say she got a ghetto booty, she have a  flat butt, and she said man, look at my ghetto booty, I started laughing and I told her where, I don't see it. But see she is my girl so we crack on each other like that. Sometimes when I talk to my friends of color, I say yea man ona fin ona fin. Then my friend of......Not so color says what is ona fin. I say, ok let me break it down for you here, let me put it in  terms to where all my caucazoid friends will understand. See, ona fin means like ona real. Then she says ok, um one more question what is ona real, I said oh I'm sorry let me break it down in silly white girl terms, on a real is seriously. No I'm not prejudice, I love everybody.  Okay, back to the real guess what*****   I love my jacket that Lamont bought me, man it is so biker, but it real, and I like it and I found 18 bucks in it.( Eliza eat your heart out I find 14 dollars more than you lol). But ya still big sister. I think I am going to save it, because if I go to karate then I will get 10 bucks from my uncle and that will be 28 bucks to have. Then if I get my money my grandma give me then that will equal to be 48 bucks, and I'm going shopping Friday, for a skirt and shoes, and I can con my friend into giving me some money. Which it just depends on how the day is going for her to give me money. ( Big up to you girl Shannette).  I would give shot outs but I don't feel like it so. I am going to end this by saying Eliza Sonia big ups to yall, I can't wait to see you girl Son. Eliza I can wait til the end of the world. Just joking Just joking, your my big sister, I can do that CHEESE.   I FINALLY BOUGHT LOTION SO MY KNEES AINT ASHY NO MORE THANK U LOOOOEEEED.          \",\n",
       " \"                                  Pride 2004: 4 Days in the Village                                        -- OR --                                Chris' Geography Lesson.       Well, my little children of the corn,  that season is upon us again! The time when the fruits of our great country bask in the gloriously gay sun and spend hours proving that --contrary to popular belief-- the gay population is NOT all about sex, nudity and liqour....   wait a minute!  Has Queer as Folk taught you nothing? This is not 'Gay as Blazes' people, this is PRIDE! the celebration of everything perverse and wrong with the gay village-- which oddly enough has me coming back for more and more and more and more and more....   So here we sit, another mass email engaging us into the story that was this weekend's festivities.  Everyone's counting on me! I must be witty, funny and 'mo beyond belief.... I'll do my best.    Our story of gay starts on a friday morning,   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Having just arrived home from work at 2am, and packing for 4 hours, I took my mother and brother downtown on NO sleep and proceeded to move my crap into an apartment,. This will now be known as the gay ghetto... it's poverty chic with a touch of Annie: The Musical... you know...  'It's the hard knock life, for us....' .   .. ah, one pararagh in and i've already made a musical reference...    All moved in and with the purchase of some lovely new Martha dishes.--.gotta give her some jail-bartering money-- I sat down on my floor, where the couch will one day be located and admired my new digs. Quite frankly, I did me some good apartment hunting.   Enter Lana, a fabulously cute lesbian/Bi-sexual/Jew who's coming to stay with my in my dining room for the weekend. It's okay, I dont have a dining room table anyway, so there's lots of space! Now this is the part where I RAVE about how good a friend Lana is.... How she came to my apartment and painted the entire living room for me, AND how she gave me an excessive amount of weed to make ME want to paint too... it's a shitty edging job, but at least the walls arent white in there anymore. So anyway, we're sitting on the carpet, in my room of ghetto gay with the nice coloured walls and Lana breaks out the guitar... says pick a song -- and we sing and sing and sing... I loved it. I found Pat Benetar and made Lana play it repeatedly.  I LOVE PAT BENETAR!   Enter more lesbians.   Samantha and Emily:         I'm calling them Lesbiennes, and my reasons for this are threefold. A) the millenium. B) they're too pretty to be dykes. and 3) Emily is from Montreal and that's funnier. They have lovely outfits for this entire weekend, and It makes me happy. They also introduce us to the most random of women throughout the weekend, whom we loose in shops on yonge street while shopping because we're mindless bitches who dont care about people...   'Where's Carly?? Oh... we left her in a store in a city she's not from... she'll find her way home. no biggie.... '    Friday night we hit the clubs and party it up style at buddies. We dance, we sing to Beyonce and BEP... let's get RETARDED, is the song people... dont PC my Gay Day.  All in all, a good night. I make out with random boys, Emily and Samantha dance like fools and Lana .... ' where's Lana?? OH... she's over there with.... OH!!!!!!!!!!!'  3am, Paul goes home making out with some boy.  930 am. Lana comes home ... okay, In reality, Lana came to my place at 430am, but I didnt hear the damn door... It's okay, she had someone to sleep over with anyway....   So we wake up saturday and I have errands to run. I have a Chris to get, I require my cute little homo so that the quota of gay can be restored... there were way too many lesbians. Thespians? lesbian thesbians? rudabega. PAT BENTAR?!!!   We get Chris on the Via, and then head back to my place. After some misdirection, we find it again, and find Mike on my doorsteps. Oh good, the three Ami-ho's are here. I love it. An hour later, Emily and Samantha are back. We're smokin in the living room, we're sipping juice from martha stewart mugs... it's divine. We head out for some shopping and then the ladies leave to get ready at Emily's... We chill out at mine and Joy and Nathan pop by a little later on. It's time for the bar:   Now, Saturday night is a little shady. It may have something to do with the fact that we were influenced by lana's magic bag of plant. It may be the fact that we started drinking at 10, and I bough 4 rounds of shots and 10 vodka coolers before i SWITCHED to beer.... liqour beofre beer people... or it may be that I just have no memory capacity at all... I'm blaming that last one, cause we all know i'm not a lush....   shut up Genevieve. You too Jeffrey.   So here's what I remember from saturday, in a nutshell:   Emily and Samantha were MIA... Buddies was the place; drinking was the game. Met bryce there with some kids I dont know, but danced with anyway. There was a boy in a sailor hat and a boa, who we made fun of then I think I made out with later. The bartender hit on me and gave me free vodka... no complaints. I met half of my highschool, made out with 3 or 4 more boys and did things i'm not happy about in a back corner.   Somehow we end up at Woody's and we meet Lana's friend from highschool, Joshua. He's cute. We make out, he says he's straight, Chris gets mad and I lose him, but I stick around and find out there's no chance in HELL this boy is straight...  nor is his friend who's wearing the dog colar and the chain. Lana leaves us, cause she cant take watching her highschool friend flirt with her university friend, and somehow i end up with part of the chain attatched to me...   NOTE TO SELF : When a cute boy and his cute friend tell you they want to tie you up, do NOT allow his cute eyes and unbuttoned shirt to sway your judgement. DO NOT DO IT....   okay do it, but, not in public.   and dont run into them the next day, it's only going to be awkward.... especially for Lana   Next thing I know, I'm reunited with Mike and two new random boys in the street. I honestly have NO idea how i got out there, just that I was no longer chained up and that was good enough for me. Having had enough cool metal on my skin, I decided it was time to roll around on the street with Heavenly Heights, a drag queen I know from Tango's.... she dances to Britney; we like her.   After many photographs of us all sprawled out on Churchstreet with a drag queen in white, I turn around to find DYLAN! Where'd Chris go?! I have no idea.... Dylan's coming home with me, despite his 8am wake up the next day. It's 5am! He's got 3 hours before he has to be up!!!  Back to my apartment... more smoke, more martha mugs and more singing with the guitar until the sun comes up at 545.... my neighbours hate me, I've been living there for a DAY lol Chris comes home, shocked and appauled that we've got 4 boys in a sleeping bag...   Now. For the sake of all of us, I'm going to leave out the next part of the night. Because, while I remember it vaguely, I dont want to. I will say this: Lana, I'm sorry you had to sleep through that, and next time, we'll get 2 sleeping bags. Or maybe just take it to my room instead of giving the neighbours a free porno show-- since I have no curtains either, they witnessed all of that. We're ignoring that.    SUNDAY!  We put memories of saturday behind us and hit up the parade. Enter Shaleen, Corrine and some kid Lana knows from Wonderland. Gay men are everywhere, and penis' are rampant. I wont delve into this too much, because frankly it was on TV and this email is already a novella.... BUT! I found love in a martini glass and an orange speedo... and driving an ambulance. I wanted.  three. beautiful men. one parade.   I think beautiful men should parade in front of me EVERY day.   All in all, a good pride day and we all had fun... except Mike who was a little hung over and sat in a store front, pretending NOT to be homeless until finally he gave up and went back to my apartment while we watched gay people strut down Yonge St.  We met up with my cousin, his friends, we walked around, we got pizza... It was time for a nap!   And..... WE're going out AGAIN! Sunday night, we headed out into the masses of people to Tango's!! Lesbian bar, extrodinaire.. We wait in Line... Cocoa shows up, and she's the screaming image of little miss shawl... with just a hint of shoulder! ;) Bryce and friends arrive, and we're all set to get in. We meet a cute couple in line... a straight boy and his gf... dont ever ASK what happend with them later... All I'm saying is, the straight bf says that if he wants it rough, he goes to Chris and if he wants it passionate and sensual he goes to me... and his girfriend just watched.   okay no, I made out with her too, I felt bad.   Chris and I got hammered again. There was a boy with Mike in Zebra Pants... who we HATED! lol... if one more person tells me that I should be a drag queen, I'm gonna puke. I KNOW ! I'm PRETTY.... just tell me that, dont delve into how i should actually be a woman. I'm a man. I like my penis. If i chose to be a drag queen, I'll let you know. Actually, I'll let courtney know first, cause she'll be my biggest fan. She loves her drag queens.   Now. HOW We ended up leaving Tango's and going to Zippers, is BEYOND me... Had I been remotely sober, I would not have alloud this to happen, as this place is TRASH. But... we were there. I did meet a spunky drag queen who was BEAUTIFUL... she was so beautiful she calls herself a female illusionist, becuase it IS an allusion that she was actually a man... she looked like more of a woman than samantha did last year at pride...   After Zippers, I dont KNOW what happend. I honestly have NO idea. Apparently we were at Woody's again, but you could have fooled me, I thought I was unconcious. Maybe Woody's was before Zippers. Maybe I was gangbanged. I dont know. I feel like Genevieve in 11th grade.   I'm sorry honey, I love you, but come on--you were an Etard.   Either way, the night ended somehow, and I ended up back in bed.... and by bed, I mean on blankets on my floor.... sorry chris.. want another pillow?! :D   MONDAY!  (Has anyone else noticed that I'm on a bender here... It's been 4 days now, and I'm still going. )   We wake up, and feel a little less worse than we did the night before. Shower, shave and smoke, and we're on our way to Fran's for yet another good ass breakfast. mmm smoothies. Chris doesnt know what a smoothie is... but of course. I explain that to him, as well as the fact that canada DOES have islands that are part of CANADA.... it's not another country Chris, it's an island in lake Ontario.... PEI is an Island too... they're not other countries.   I think this is an appropriate time for me to mention the following:  Chris honey, I love you. You are fantastic. But... you're a little bit blonde. *Kiss*  I'm going to share with the good people the top 5 Chris Rabideau dumb ass comments: He's going to hit me for this, but you know what? I bought him Madonna tickets for his birthday and if he's mean he doesnt get to go.   5) Coata Rica... like... I dont get it? It's the Coast of What? Where's Rica?   4) Oh, You're in central america.... so where's that on the globe... like down down down under?   3) Oh look, Bag Pipes! I love Ireland!   2) Oh, Ireland, Scotland... whatever... I dont know my states!   1) I will NOT be the butt of everyone's jokes anymore... why does everyone laugh when i say butt?    I love you baby! lol    SO... On the way home from Frans for breakfast, having called in sick to work... We decided, Mike, Chris and Me... to stop by woody's for ONE drink.   ONE DRINK   it's 2pm and we sit down with our ONE drink   .............at 530pm, Mike had missed his train and was staying another day. We'd met a lovely lesbian named Cathy, who was almost bitchier than me, cute boys all around, including sean, the cool/cute guy from Belleville..... NOTE: Samantha.... remember balletboy from last pride??? where was he from??? BELLEVILLE.... I'm moving to Belleville.   So there we are still on the patio of Woody's. It's 6pm and Chris and I leave to take him to my place to get ready and pack and get his train. Mike stays with cutie Sean, who we all love and is officially added to my MSN via those cute pick up notepads at Woodys... NAME______ NUMBER______ I love the organization of gay men. Even picking up has a process.   I take chris to say our goodbyes, buy him some chocolate and watch sadly as he gets onto a train. One gay down.... one to go. He's back in 3 weeks, I'll be okay!   Oh wait... where am I going??? I have to get Mike at the bar!   8pm I arrive BACK at the bar. Lana shows up. We drink more.  Lana and I go back to get her stuff from my apartment for her to go home.  I'm wasted by 9pm   I go out with Samantha and Emily to a cool live music bar.... we drink wine.   I'm wasted.   I go back to Woody's   I'm wasted.   I drink more??   we stumble home with some new boys we met at woody's, and i finally crash with Mike and Sean at my place.   lol.... please note how they BOTH had trains to catch and missed them that night, as well as the next morning.    I'm on a BENDER....    Overall, I think it was one of the banger Pride years. I'm a tad upset at some fabulous lesbians who are not in on this email, and thus.... did not SHOW UP! Kim and Ange, though you're lovely girls.... I'm disappointed. I love you anyway, but I'm disappointed.   So to sum it all up, we close as we always do... with the covetted top ten moments of Pride 2004. It's a list that will go down in history as some of the funniest shit ever uttered.   and so it goes:    10) The Gay Ghetto... it's poverty chic. It's very zen.... and by zen I mean zer ain't nothing in zee damn plaze.   9) 'Somebody get Chris some shoulderpads... he's liable to hurt himself.' '.... actually, I think he needs kneepads. '   8) 'Where's Carly?.... oops'   7) Bomber Jacket Baby... DangerShark and Jawbreaker prevail. It's the only reason I'm forgiving them for being MIA on saturday.   6) Chris learns geography: We dont know how he graduated highschool.... but he claims it was legit.   5) Fran's restaurant.... ' excuse me, do you have any frozen margaritas? I'm on a bender.... thanks '   4) Black Eyed Peas.     3) 'let's go have one quick drink before the train.....'   2) Any excuse for Paul to dance circles around you, will be taken.   1) PAT BENETAR?!??!?!?!?!?!?????!!!!!!!   There are two things I want to do before I close this LONG email. First thank all of those who read the whole damn thing, which is not many I'm sure. Genevieve.. you're one of them, and I love you for it. you're my #1 fruit fly and I was so sad you werent here with me. Jeffrey, you MAY have read this far, and if so, you love me more than I thought.... lol. I miss you too, and will see you soon.   Lastly, I think the kids involved in pride desrve a round of applause. Or at least their livers do...  Samantha and Emily... I love you both.  Mike... you could not be a nicer guy. We require more gay between us, I've said this many times.  Lana... I love... let's sing my immortal ONE more time.  Chris... what can I say? I love you! you're cute and funny and sweet and just the right amount of naive. Happy Birthday, baby!    Until next time,  keep fit, and have gay   love always,          \",\n",

BUSH                         1600 Pennsylvania Avenue                          Washington, DC 20520                           EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE Law Enforcement:  I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.                                                   Military:  I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.                                                   College: I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.                                                   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:                          I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland,Texas, in 1975.                           I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil inTexas. The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock. Ibought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money.                           With the help of my father and our friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.                                                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS                          I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America.                           I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money.                           I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history.                           With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.                                                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:                          I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record.                           I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.                           I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury.                           I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.                           I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period.                           I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.                           I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market. In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend continues every month.                           I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.                           I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President.                           I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.                           My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. History, Enron.                           My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.                           I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip- offs in history.                           I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed. I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.                           I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.                           I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.                           I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government.                           I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.                           I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.                           I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.                           I refused to allow inspector's access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.                           I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).                           I set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any President since the advent of television.                           I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.                           I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history.                           I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind.                           I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community.                           I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active duty troops and their families -- in wartime.                           In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq and then blamed the lies on our British friends.                           I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.                           I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD.                           I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden [sic] to justice.

       " \"                                  The hypocrosy of Noam Chomsky   There’s a famous definition in the Gospels of the hypocrite, and the hypocrite is  the person who refuses to apply to himself the standards he applies to others.  —Noam Chomsky, Power and Terror, 2003    Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His undergraduate and graduate years were spent at the University of Pennsylvania where he received his PhD in linguistics in 1955. During the years 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was a Junior Fellow of the Harvard University Society of Fellows. While a Junior Fellow he completed his doctoral dissertation entitled, 'Transformational Analysis.' The major theoretical viewpoints of the dissertation appeared in the monograph Syntactic Structure, which was published in 1957. This formed part of a more extensive work, The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory, circulated in mimeograph in 1955 and published in 1975.Chomsky joined the staff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955 and in 1961 was appointed full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics (now the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.) From 1966 to 1976 he held the Ferrari P. Ward Professorship of Modern Languages and Linguistics. In 1976 he was appointed Institute Professor.  During the years 1958 to 1959 Chomsky was in residence at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, NJ. In the spring of 1969 he delivered the John Locke Lectures at Oxford; in January 1970 he delivered the Bertrand Russell Memorial Lecture at Cambridge University; in 1972, the Nehru Memorial Lecture in New Delhi, and in 1977, the Huizinga Lecture in Leiden, among many others.  Noam Chomsky is obviously a  men of high esteem and by all means an intellegent men, that is not the poin of critisim here. I will in this site point out some of his hypocratic stances.                         'CHOMSKY'S SUPPORT FOR COMMUNIST CHINA'   Chomsky told a forum in New York in December, 1967 that in China “one finds many things that are really quite admirable.” He believed the Chinese had gone some way to empowering the masses along lines endorsed by his own libertarian socialist principles:  'China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting and positive things happened at the local level, in which a good deal of the collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step.  When he provided this endorsement of what he called Mao Tse-tung’s “relatively livable” and “just society,” Chomsky was probably unaware he was speaking only five years after the end of the great Chinese famine of 1958–1962, the worst in human history. He did not know, because the full story did not come out for another two decades, that the very collectivization he endorsed was the principal cause of this famine, one of the greatest human catastrophes ever, with a total death toll of thirty million people.                  'When the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in 1975 both Chomsky and the New Left welcomed it. And when news emerged of the extraordinary event that immediately followed, the complete evacuation of the capital Phnom Penh accompanied by reports of widespread killings, Chomsky offered a rationalization similar to those he had provided for the terror in China and Vietnam: there might have been some violence, but this was understandable under conditions of regime change and social revolution.   Although information was hard to come by, Chomsky suggested in an article in 1977 that post-war Cambodia was probably similar to France after liberation at the end of World War II when thousands of enemy collaborators were massacred within a few months. This was to be expected, he said, and was a small price to pay for the positive outcomes of the new government of Pol Pot. Chomsky cited a book by two American left-wing authors, Gareth Porter and George Hildebrand, who had “presented a carefully documented study of the destructive American impact on Cambodia and the success of the Cambodian revolutionaries in overcoming it, giving a very favorable picture of their programs and policies.”   By this time, however, there were two other books published on Cambodia that took a very different line. The American authors John Barron and Anthony Paul called their work Murder of a Gentle Land and accused the Pol Pot regime of mass killings that amounted to genocide. Franзois Ponchaud’s Cambodia Year Zero repeated the charge.   Chomsky reviewed both books, together with a number of press articles, in The Nation in June 1977. He accused them of publishing little more than anti-communist propaganda. Articles in The New York Times Magazine and The Christian Science Monitor suggested that the death toll was between one and two million people out of a total population of 7.8 million. Chomsky mocked their total and picked at their sources, showing some were dubious and that a famous photograph of forced labor in the Cambodian countryside was actually a fake.   He dismissed the Barron and Paul book partly because it had been published by Reader’s Digest and publicized on the front page of The Wall Street Journal, both of them notorious anti-communist publications, and partly because they had omitted to report the views of journalists who had been to Cambodia but not witnessed any executions.   Ponchaud’s book was harder to ignore. It was based on the author’s personal experience in Cambodia from 1965 until the capture of Phnom Penh, extensive interviews with refugees and reports from Cambodian radio. Moreover, it had been favorably reviewed by a left-wing author in The New York Review of Books, a publication for which Chomsky himself had often written. Chomsky’s strategy was to undermine Ponchaud’s book by questioning the credibility of his refugee testimony. Acknowledging that Ponchaud “gives a grisly account of what refugees have reported to him about the barbarity of their treatment at the hands of the Khmer Rouge,” Chomsky said we should be wary of “the extreme unreliability of refugee reports”:  This is just a small example of Noam Chomsky;s Hypcrosy please visit this ite to read more about his Hypocrisy.

I came back home around 11 am and I went to bed. Brian called at 2 but I was still tired so he let me go back to sleep. He woke me up again at 3 and we decided to see each other, however I fell back asleep when I got off the phone and didn't get up until 4. I got ready, and saw my Baby! We went to Diamondhead Records and Brian bought a really awesome Cradle of Filth video. The video itself isn't cool, but the case of it is! hehe! He also bought an import from Japan Iron Maiden cd. Which is awesome, I love Iron Maiden, its the original one too, made in 1985, not remastered either. Then we went to Kroger and home. We decided to go to a movie, 'The Chronicles of Riddick.' The movie was at 9:20pm. It was a good movie. I liked it, once I understood it completly. I wasn't paying attention to the beginning of it I was thinking of other things. hehe! oppsie. Sabrina hadn't called in awhile and I had been wondering why, well today I found out why! She had left her cell phone in my car and I didn't know it. So after the movie she had gotten a hold of me and we went to her house and brought her cell phone to her. I need Help! I need ideas of things to do. There just isn't much to do. Brian and I have rented almost every movie there is. Eating out doesn't really consist of doing something fun. The mall is extremely boring. No good movies out. Brian doesn't really like to hang out with our friends so thats out. I want to learn how to sew but I know it would bore Brian to tears. Brian needs to put his band together. I think itd atleast give us something to do. I think itd be fun to help him. Maybe Ill talk to him about it. I wish I was artistic. I guess once we get a job we'll have less time on our hands. Speaking of which, we're turning in our job applications tomorrow. hmmm. I need to buy a camera, I want pictures of my Baby and me!

I laid awake all night with my mind racing about today and the months to come.  I got up at 8 and went down to set up my booth.  All went pretty well, until around 10 when I realized I'd forgotten to bring any paper to draw on... haha.  So I headed home and grabbed some bristol and decided to go ahead and bring up my airbrush and compressor, just to get back into the practice of using it.  It turned out to be a good thing.   I really needed the practice.  My drawings, as was the case before, are good and really look like the people, and I can do them quickly - about 3 minutes per person - but the airbrush is still the bane of my existence.  The first one took 30 minute to color (Gah!) and I had about 20 old hispanic men walk up queringly to ask me how much the compressor was for sale for?  Apparently I was so bad at this that they thought I was here to sell compressors.  Sigh.  It took me about 3 drawings to remember that you have to really crank up the PSI for an airbrush, so that the air actually moves fast enough to get the paint where you want it to go, instead of sneezing embarrasingly all over the page.  I'm writing down all the things I forgot to remember so that I never forget to remember them again.  Anyways, as the day went by things got better.  i started hearing more parents say stuff like 'he really captured her eyes' or 'Oh my God it looks just like her.'  So that's always a good sign that I'm on the right track.  And somewhere around 2 or 3 o'clock things started to really click again and the rest of the day went pretty well, very well actually.  I not only broke even and recouped my costs, I actually made a profit of $30 bucks.  Not bad, especially considering I lost money my first three outings last go-round.  I expect to make a $100 tomorrow after expenses.  And then I expect it will average out at about a hundred a day for this flea market.  I'm happy with that, mainly because I'm not even charging full price.  It will take me a while to get to where I feel comfortable and professional with doing this, so I don't mind playing it low-key till then.  But in the long run it will be well worth it.  I suspect with the flea market and Post old mill trade days I'll be averaging about $1,000 a month for these first few months.  Not bad for 2 days a week.  I want to thank all of you that came out today.  Oh and Happy birthday Adrienne, hope you liked your picture, and say hey to Frank for me.  And I especially want to thank Sara for helping to kick my ass in gear for this.  Sometimes we all need a swift boot to the rear to remember what's important.  Anyone else that's interested (in visiting me, not kicking me in the ass cheeks), I'll be out there again tomorrow.  It's at the Clovis Highway Flea Market.  I'm outside in the aisle between the two buildings.  I'll be the one covered in paint and frustration.   --Will     \",\n",

       " \"                                  by             jon wilcox    STORIES started November, 1982 BLOG started June 3, 2004  Introduction Part I  I sat back comfortably in the Acela Regional and watched the brown dusky twilight of a November Massachusetts evening glide past the window. The bus from Boston to Manhattan is faster, surprisingly, but the train provides considerably more legroom, and an arrival time that would not be drastically extended by a Westchester traffic jam. If cell phone use was eliminated it would be a nearly perfect form of transportation. Three conductors conference in the aisle next to me, their attire and their demeanor seemingly unchanged for a century, I look up and imagine them breaking into the opening number from “The Music Man.” The large male conductor turns and leans into my row to let his female colleague past. His belly is too big to button his jacket and he leans it over the edge of the fortunately vacant seat next to me in a position that resembles what he must look like leaning into a urinal. He turns and continues speaking to her, swings his head around when she passes and removes his stomach from my personal space. He does not offend, however—practically nothing does these days. Shivers run up and down my spine. If they are from the Yohimbine my psychiatrist recently prescribed or the satisfaction of the twenty-year arc ending around me, I am unsure. This is clearly not the world I lived in in 1982. It is easier for me to remember some of the minutest details of my life then, than it is to remember the name of a restaurant I ate in last week. But they say Einstein didn’t remember his own phone number, so I don’t mind.  Twenty years ago this week I rode in a bus down University Avenue from St. Paul to Minneapolis. The fall of my freshman year had passed by in a haze undoubtedly caused by the thrill of leaving my parent’s house, the challenge of courses I couldn’t sleep through and ace, the combination of beer, vodka, and lemonade Hamline freshman called “strip and go nakeds,” and another organic pleasure known as “Maui-wowie.”  I had had sex with only two people previously. A female camp counselor named Sandy who stole my virginity on the 4th of July in 1981, and a boy in my High School that most affectionately, or not so, was known as Rob the “choir fag,” or Rob the “drama head.” At a graduation night party that became a tame Midwestern choir kid’s make-out orgy, the two of us found ourselves fondling each other as we kissed the two Sheilas. The two comedic girls of the same name were always suspected of being lesbians. Rob and I escaped to the privacy of an empty room down the hall where I discovered that I had somehow magically developed a talent for performing filatio. Rob completely freaked afterwards, to which I had two thoughts: “this seems out of character for a ‘choir fag,’” and “you didn’t even do anything asshole.”  “What does this mean? What does this mean?” Rob screeched. If I could put myself back into the situation with my current perspective, I might have responded:  “It means I gave you a blowjob.”  But the fact that the most-gay person in my school couldn’t really deal with the fact gave me pause. In fact, it gave me fear. What did this mean? Perhaps this was unnatural. Perhaps even the gayest of characters isn’t really gay. I was pleased by my newfound skill. I had imagined I was preparing for someone really special as I gave myself the best orgasms of my young life by probing around with a broomstick or tennis racket handle. Perhaps it is depraved as everyone says.  The 16A rolled across the intersection of Snelling and University and I boarded. I had forgotten to get a transfer but afraid of trying to explain that to the driver, I paid another 75 cents and headed to the back of the bus—where the cool people sit. A mountain of laundry for mom filled one bag; a mountain of homework from the past three weeks filled the other. As usual, I had attempted to cure a hangover with a big breakfast of pancakes, eggs, bacon, orange-juice and Coca-cola. It almost worked and I felt strangely energized and ready to face my family, a task that took surprising amounts of the stuff.  Then it happened. And I believe that is the appropriate phrase. For this was the beginning of the writing of this book and it happened to me. I “knew” I would write it, and I knew that this moment was the start of it. I didn’t know it would take twenty years to congeal in my brain before it actually got down on electronic paper. But I have never and will never forget the absurd moments that followed and what went on in my brain. For years I had no idea what exactly it was that burned some of these moments so into my memory, but at least now I have some clues.  Ahead of me on the nearly empty bus about six rows, a strange pair sat across from one another on the aisle. A black businessman in a suit and trench coat sat with his briefcase on his lap. Across from him, an even more un-politically correctly described “old lady” sat with a plastic scarf covering her hair, her cat-like metal eyeglasses neatly pushed under the scarf and an umbrella in her hand. It’s not many Minnesotans that carry umbrellas in the winter--what’s the use? But perhaps she was from elsewhere.  Suddenly, and without warning, the black businessman sneezed. But it was the kind of sneeze where the person plugs their nose and tries not to let the sneeze out. It sounded more like a high, shrill mouse squeak than a human sneeze. I don’t think it’s good to sneeze that way. I think the energy of the sneeze needs to be projected outward. When someone sneezes that way, I think the energy from the sneeze is projected directly back into the brain and probably causes some kind of brain damage over time. I don’t know this as a medical fact, but most people I tell agree with me. When I sneeze, I try to do the opposite, I don’t necessarily cover my mouth and I blast the sneeze out and make as much noise as I possibly can. I often add an “oooooweeee” afterwards to add to the drama. Now that’s a healthier sneeze.  I think the swallowed sneeze also indicates a lot about the sneezer. It implies a good deal of anal retention and fear. I knew that man was uptight, probably an accountant or lawyer, was spanked a lot during his toilet training and enjoyed balancing checkbooks and other things that he could make “perfect.” As a reaction to the businessman’s sneeze, the old lady turned suddenly and then paused, as if to say, “What the hell kind of sneeze was that? Don’t you know you can get brain damage from that kind of sneeze?” But she didn’t say that. Instead she uttered what I marked as a completely absurd thing to say in a quiet, stilted, timid voice: “Gazhuntheit.”  “Thank you,” he replied and wiped his nose with a handkerchief.  Now I was appalled. What the hell kind of conversation was that. Is that really what two people in the world should say to each other as they drive down University Avenue on the day before Thanksgiving? It was obvious to me that the woman had never spoken to a black person before. Thus the pause when she turned to see the sneezer. She feared and was attracted to the man at the same time. Growing up in a rural area she had never seen a black person until well into her 30s and she’d never, never spoken to one before. Then, when she did have this remarkable opportunity to connect with someone of a different race for the first time, what does she say? “Gazhuntheit???”   Completely absurd.  Then the real moment happened. I suddenly began thinking about what I was thinking about. How did I get on this rampage about gazhuntheit? How did I know so much about the businessman and the old lady? I knew what I was thinking about them was true. Absolutely. But how could I know that? How did I start making these circles around my brain, perceiving about my perception?  Then I got this wonderful, warm, loving feeling in my chest. I loved the black businessman. I loved the old woman. I love the world and I see that we can connect with one another just like this couple did on a 16A bus riding down University Avenue on a Wednesday in November 1982. Another discovery: Does everyone have thoughts like this when they are riding public transportation? I think they do! I am so happy and so enlightened and I want to share that with the whole world in a book. I must write this down in a book called “Thoughts While Riding Public Transportation,” and let people know this amazing fact: we can connect with each other and that is good.   Introduction Part II  I arrived in downtown Minneapolis in the early afternoon to transfer to a bus that would take me to my Grandmother’s home in Golden Valley. After my epiphany with the couple on the 16A, I was feeling at one with the world. It was a brisk November afternoon in Minnesota, which for most of the rest of the world means freezing cold. I bounced lightly in place and blew on my hands for warmth. Suddenly, which is a word I’ll use for most of these moments, a voice startled me from behind.  “Is that a backpack?”  I turned to see an elderly woman—although I wouldn’t say old—she was smartly dressed and had a warmth to her face that would cause me to say “elderly.” Besides, she definitely wasn’t wearing a plastic scarf over her head.  “Excuse me?” I said.  “Is that a backpack? My grandson wants one for Christmas and I didn’t know what they were.”  “Yes, this is a backpack…that’s what is alright.”  “Oh, I’m so glad I asked you. Thank you. Are you going home for Thanksgiving?”  “I’m going to my Grandmother’s. I’m meeting my family there.”  “Oh, that’s so nice for your Grandmother. Are you in school?”  “Yes, I’m a freshman at Hamline University.”  “Oh, is your Grandmother Nellie DeCoursey.”  “What!? Well, yes, um, how did you know?”  “I’m her neighbor, Elizabeth. I’m waiting for the bus too.”  As if my one-world feeling needed to be increased any more at this point, a small-world interaction brought me to an even higher feeling of euphoria. Of all the people to run into in crowded downtown Minneapolis, but my Grandmother’s neighbor and of all the topics of conversation to draw us together but a backpack. The magic continued.  Unlike many times to follow, my euphoria was not followed by a deep fear that the world, or I, was about to end. I remember once driving by Flying Cloud Airport and down an embankment overlooking the Minnesota River. At this time of year, it overlooked a breathtaking pageant of red, gold, and orange fall colors. It was truly beautiful and I remember feeling so good that I could run around and kiss each of the trees. But quickly, the euphoria began to worry me. Why did I feel so good? I felt so good that it seemed the only answer was that I was about to die. I began driving much more conscientiously. I began to prepare for oncoming cars swerving into my lane. I pictured the twisted wreckage, my body burned beyond recognition, my parents trying to identify me in a morgue somewhere. That was pretty much enough to kill the euphoria.  As I will attest to in Chapter 5, cars are public transportation. But it is communication through steel. Wearing suits of armor on the freeway, usually our conversations are none too polite. Who hasn’t given a good “fuck you,” to a driver around us, with a gesture, a swerve into his lane, or high beams in the rear view mirror? It’s easy. Who would ever do that to a person next to us on the subway no matter how obnoxious they were being? Take off the armor and we’re much more like the person next to us than we’d like to believe. Take off the armor and one human is pretty much like the next.    CHAPTER 1  BILLY JEAN IS NOT MY LOVER  I’ll try not to get sentimental as I look back, but St. Paul, Minnesota was a wonderful place to go to college. There are seven major colleges and of course the behemoth University of Minnesota not far away. I chose Hamline University because my father was a Methodist Minister and therefore I received a third off tuition, and because the school I really wanted to go to, Carleton College in Northfield, had had the nerve to waitlist me on the first round.  There are those decisions that change everything forever. I used to regret the decision to go to Hamline. I used to regret many things. But in the end, if some of the greatest joys in your life come from some of the most painful and disturbing times, how can you regret them?  In the fall of 1982 Michael Jackson was still black and presumably sane. His album “Thriller,” had sold 700 trillion copies in perhaps the last big sweep of LP sales before cassettes and CDs took over the market. It was still pretty cool to like Michael Jackson, even if you were a freshman WASP at an urban liberal arts college.  In January, all the liberal arts colleges celebrated the Interim, or J-Term period. A month long chance to “study” marine biology in Hawaii or painting in Italy if you were rich enough, or to only have one course to cross campus for during the nastiest month of the Minnesota winter.  I had not auditioned, but “coincidentally” got the chance to change classes and sing in an opera for my J-Term project. Students from five St. Paul colleges were coming together to perform, “The Unicorn, the Gorgon, and the Manticore,” by Gian Carlo Menotti. The Director was a brilliant and warm man, who I subsequently saw play “Sweeny Todd,” at the Chimera Theater. Years later, I also heard he had died prematurely of “Legionnaires Disease,” in closeted 1987 Minnesota, I suspect this was a code word for AIDS.  I forget many of the details of what came next, so I will keep my comments to what I believe are “just the facts.” During the rehearsal period, a soprano named Janice Tomkins and I began dating, began a sexual relationship, daydreamed about what our children’s names would be (Drew was the first choice for a boy). One night, I smoked pot and tried to break off the relationship because I felt so guilty for doing so and didn’t need another mother. She said she thought it was cool that I smoked pot and asked me to come and get her the next time I was going to do it.     CHAPTER 2  The Big Man On Campus  The metaphor did not get past me.  Few did in those days.  In my manic-psychotic dream that spring of 1996, the entire world was a metaphor.  The mountains around Pasadena resembled, no, were the mountains around Jerusalem.  Street signs shouted subliminal messages that only the chosen could see.  The signs had always been right there, but only now were the messages making themselves known to me.  Even daily routines like showering took on magnificent meaning.  I said aloud, “A baptism every day, John,” consciously inserting an “h” into my name so there could be no mistake as to my identity. But the metaphor that later struck me most strange was the open closet door.  Not the altar that I had prepared in Peter’s spare bedroom.  Not the thirty-four cents I used to buy back my soul from the beggar outside a 7-11 when my total had come to $6.66.  Not even the nap I took in the mountain hideaway where I was able to sleep soundly and watch myself sleeping at the same time.  The closet door wasn’t even an intended metaphor.  One of the two sliding doors needed to be opened to balance the energy of the two mirrors.  The powers of feng shui, psychic energy cosmic balancing, and the ability to see angels, devils, and subliminal messages from God were among the powers granted to me in those days.  I have never felt as blessed as I did then.  I know I am still blessed, but if only I could feel it more like I did at that time.  But those days were part of the insanity that I will call the second time I came out. The first and third times were far less dramatic, but more of what might be called, “real.”  My first real boyfriend and I came out to each other on Halloween night in the fall of 1983.  Returning to my dorm room from an off-campus costume party where he played a minstrel-like Michael Jackson and I did my best James Dean impression, it now seems pretty obvious that we were gay.  But in small-town, pre-AIDS, southern Minnesota, these two nineteen year-olds had not yet reached that level of sophistication.  I hadn’t dared to tell anyone about the incident on the night of my High School graduation.  (I mean, everyone knew Rob was gay.  How could he have been so upset about a damn blowjob?)  Becoming consciously aware of our homosexuality held little appeal with no campus gay and lesbian organization, no gay bars closer than Minneapolis, and no role models except for Boy George, Liberace, and ostracized cousins.  So, as Dan showered off the shoe-polish, I anxiously waited in my single room with loft.   He was beautiful.  I was surprised we had even become friends.  He looked everything like the college hero.  I was surprised when I found out he wasn’t a senior, but a sophomore like me.  He was friends with all the cool people in choir (is that an oxymoron?) and he was in a frat.  I had barely survived my freshman year at another college where I desperately searched for a girlfriend, then found one who, as fate always has it, was as lonely and in denial as I was.  Within three months she was pregnant and we got engaged then disengaged. Then I got drunk, stoned, and taken to County Hospital with a pulse of 180 and a blood pressure of 170 over 130, capillaries popping in my brain.  I left that University by ambulance and did not return.  My new isolated, idyllic, rural private Lutheran college promised a welcome escape.  So with all the confidence and false-bravado of a nineteen-year-old who’d just been trash compacted, I was surprised when the B.M.O.C. called me over to his table during lunch.  I was even more surprised when we actually became friends.  I mean, I lived in Wahlstrom—the nerd dorm.  I couldn’t believe that a respectable resident of North Hall and the only freshman to tour Europe with the Gustavus Choir last year would dare set foot in my pod of six-single-rooms around a common area and bath.  And yet he was!  And he was in the shower now.  And he's coming in here soon in a towel.  Shit!  The next few moments were among the most fearful and exciting of my life: Dan in a towel and white-faced once again; me in shorts and a T-shirt sitting on, and looking at, the floor.   “I need to tell you something.”  I say, horrified by my own words.  I glance at his eyes.  Am I really going on with this?  “What is it, what’s wrong?” The soft, strong tenor voice teases and taunts me.  Why would he think something is wrong?  Is it just because I can’t stop staring at the flecks in the gray carpet between my legs? The moment of truth.  I leap off a ninety-foot cliff into the inward rushing Pacific or headfirst onto the bare rocks below.  But I cleverly coded the language so that perhaps the meaning could be altered if it wasn’t well received.  “I think I like you too much.”  I finally say and actually muster the courage to look at the beautiful face.  And then, an amazing thing: soft brown eyes, the hint of a smile, a blush, and an answer that thrilled, frightened, and exhilarated:  “I don’t think so.”  That night may have been the happiest of our relationship.  So relieved to have found each other, we had no thought of what this night meant to anyone outside of that single room.  We never made it into the loft.  But on the floor below, with the window over us framing the thunderstorm outside, we touched, we kissed, we made love, we held each other and did nothing but breathe.   It was light by the time we slept and only two hours after shutting my eyes, still in Dan’s arms, my alarm clock’s piercing tone threw me into a frenzy of clothes, toothpaste and scrambling to meet fellow music students for our trip to the American Choral Conductors Association convention in Minneapolis.  Whether it was the two hours of sleep, the six Sloe Gin fizzes or something else in my stomach, all I remember about the drive up was staring out the window at the dead grass by the highway and trying not to throw up.  The sound of various students trying to brown-nose our professor did not help my condition, either.  I probably wouldn’t have joined their conversation even if I weren’t so afraid that if I moved I would vomit.  After hearing a dozen or more of the Upper Midwest’s most prestigious choral groups and driving back to campus, I found Dan by the library, by chance.  I was afraid again.  Had we really done that?  Did he still like me?  For God’s sake what did it mean?  Should we let it happen again?  And the most frightening thought of all: what if anyone finds out?          \",\n",

       " \"                                  ok, im not here to nit pick (well actually i am) but hasnt anyone alse knoticed that there are a lot of good books that are being slaughtered at the merciles hands of movie directors? Take Lord of the Rings, Matilda and even the Bible! All of these great books have turned into movies. Take the most recent example of the great book(s), I Robot by Isaac Asimov. Now i havent seen the movie so i dont know if they've butchered it or not, but the book is very intricat and  no one  could ever be able to portray that in a 2 hour movie. Another more well known example is the Harry Potter series bu J.K. Rowling. The books are very good pieces of childrens lit which im sure will become classics but the movies? i dont think they will go on the top shelf with The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, just because they were made by money hungery prodicers and direcotors who wanted to make a quick buck. I mean, were at the 3rd movie and 5th book, the books took well over 5 years to write and the movies? possably 3. At this rate the movies will catch up to the books within a couple of years and bu then the actors will be older, well past puberty and unable to play their Harry Potter counterparts. And for what, so a bunch of people could get rich. Why not wait till J.K. is done writing the books to start a movie franchise. Or, start when shes at the 6th book so you can make your movies and not have to wait for, or rush the writer.  No back to the real reason ive started this rant. One of my favorite books that came out a few years ago called Abarat by Clive Barker, yes,  that  clive barker (the mastermind behind many of todays horror flicks) recently aquired a webpage (how sweet). Well upon checkign the website out i clicked on a link that said 'Movie'. My first reaction was 'cool an Abarat movie maybe it wont fall into the traps like other book-to-film books', but when i got to the opened link i gasped in horror (well not really, but for effect, lets say i did). Within the first paragraph it said (and i quote) 'The book of ABARAT was so captivating that the Walt Disney Company purchased the movie, theme park, and multimedia rights to the series for $8 million dollars.' ...(moment of silence for effect)... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i yelled, they cant do this to a perfecty good book and Disney for gods sake, WHY did Disney have to buy it! The book is going the way of Pirates Of the Caribbean (in reverse) with the disneyland ride!!! aarrgghh, im boiling with rage ready to bite the head off of the next passerby (which in this case would be Holly, excuse me while i run after her). Im sorry but there are going to be 4 books in the Abarat series (the second due in october) and they are wanting to start a movie now!!! It took Clive 2 years to write and illustrate the second one (im assuming he worked on it from when the first one was published), so if they wanted to do a movie now, they (thoes bastards at Disney) woudl be waiting a long time to do the last 2. Plus, this book is so rich with detail they would have to enclude  every  detain to make the plot make sence. As with I Robot, you simply cant fit that much detail into 2 hours of film.  Whew! Im done untill next time, -Leslee            \",\n",

Fines are fine, but doesn't it just go to the state? The victim doesn't get anything, AFAIK.)     saw  I, Robot  tonight; much better than I thought it would be.

One of our local DJs got called on it from the studio (true story).     Listened to local Christian radio station last week for about 20-30 minutes. There was no Stephen Curtis Chapman--I was massively shocked. I thought Christian music was equivalent to SCC (not to be confused with the SEC, in whom I take no stock, nor should it be confused with the FCC, who might fine me for what I think of SCC--well, only if I spoke it on-air somewhere. Of course, my opinion of SCC would probably incite a riot -- is that what it would take for Christians to take some kind of action?). Anywayz, I heard this super-annoying song. It turned out to be Switchfoot; I think the song was 'The Beautiful Letdown'. That off-key note on this 'on' sound, over and over and over again. Blech.     Listened again to the local Christian radio station for about 10 minutes. A catchy song followed by some old-sounding song followed by a song that had lame (read: clich&eacute;) lyrics, mediocre vocals, uninspiring music. Sure enough, it was SCC. It's bound to be a hit.     Going to a baseball game tomorrow night for free (except parking and food). $40 seats. Wahoo!

       " \"                                 A Few Thoughts About Reagan     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reagan's death has touched off lots of commentary  on some of my favorite blogs.&nbsp;  Matt  Ellis &nbsp;recently argued, among other things, that Reagan's simplicity,  charm and old-time patriotism struck a nerve with an electorate that was tired  out by the chaos of the sixties and the seventies.&nbsp; He argues that this  electorate simply didn't look at Reagan closely and that this laziness on the  part of the electorate is to be blamed for Reagan's rise.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I think there's a lot of truth to this, I think  it's important to note that the Democratic Party bears much&nbsp;blame for  Reagan's rise.&nbsp; Democrats, after all, got us stuck in Vietnam and then the  left of the party created the social unrest that made people yearn for a simpler  time and simpler folks like Reagan.&nbsp; We also fielded weak candidates like  Carter and Mondale.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the social forces underlying our coalition were  breaking apart.&nbsp; The South was ready to leave the party.&nbsp; The civil  war was distant enough and the sixties and the civil rights  movement&nbsp;highlighted the gap on social views between Northern Democrats and  the South.&nbsp; Moreover, many Midwesterners were alienated by the same social  issues and, with Carter's failure on the economic front, Democrats couldn't as  easily claim to be the best party for the workingman.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the shift to a political environment that emphasized  coalition-splitting social issues was also partly a choice.&nbsp; The women's  movement wanted to go all out on abortion and the equal rights amendment.&nbsp;  Environmentalists, gun control advocates and death penalty opponents&nbsp;were  getting new salience for their issues as well.&nbsp; These choices by Democratic  pressure groups contributed to the shifting political atmosphere and&nbsp;did us  no favor at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinton's victories in the 90s weren't simply a result  of Bush's failure.&nbsp; Clinton understood the roots of the party's  problems.&nbsp; He took a middle tack on social issues, flying home to Arkansas  to sign the death warrant of a retarded killer, promising to make abortion  'safe, legal and rare' and to 'end welfare as we know it'.&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also struck a skillful note on economic issues.&nbsp;  He allayed the concerns of the country club set that the party would break the  bank by promising to be fiscally responsible.&nbsp; And his promises of an  undefined health care plan were vague enough to not create budget worries but  salient enough to touch a key nerve with the working class that feared for their  health insurance.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Reagan can't be blamed merely on the American  electorate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Democrats were complicit in his rise.&nbsp; And Clinton's  defeat of the Republican machine wasn't pure&nbsp;happenstance.&nbsp; It was  strategy.                 \",\n",

It is agreed by many, that the only thing sensible about the Super-lush George Best was his excellent decision to come and play for Hibs in the Eighties. ( Jambos eat your heart out! ) While I heartily concur with this Sentiment, it angers me greatly to read now, that the Great Man is now being credited with the marked decline in the 'Great Liver Donor-Missing Numbers Scandal' Bollocks. As the figures show, only 10% of recipients of new Liver Operations are alcoholics, this Mass Hysteria is groundless.     Well Fuck the PC. Prats and Holy Willies. I have a Cunning Retaliatory Plan!      As a Weel-Kent Lush in my time, (although never aspiring to Besties Standards), I made a decision to donate my liver for transplant upon the occasion of my demise. However, I made the stipulation that the Organ was to go only in the direction of a deserving Alcoholic.  Well fuck me. The furore this caused was incredible! If I'd said 'Whites only' I could understand it, but it seemed the whole Medical World was up in arms over what I considered a rather sensible idea, and, at the same time, hitting back at the 'Alcoholics are Bad Men' paranoia. Now the powers that be, while happy to accept my Liver, (They havenae seen it yet!) have declined the proviso, while assuring me that NO conditions are acceptable.   Where does this leave me?

Fingers touch to find my way, Each foot fall, my heart betrays The fear which drives me through the day.  Suddenly the ground is lost, Flailing arms as body's tossed.

       " \"                                 File Types  Created for Visual C++ Projects   Starter files are automatically generated for your Visual C++ project,  whenever you create one either by using a wizard (such as the MFC AppWizard or  the ActiveX ControlWizard) or one of the icons (such as the Application icon)  available on the  Projects  tab of the  New  dialog.   This topic describes all the types of files that are associated with Visual  C++ projects. The actual files included in your project will depend on the  project type and the options you select when using a wizard.  PROJNAME   represents the name of your project.   What kind of files do you want to know more about?        Project Files and Makefiles        Program or Control source and header files        Precompiled header files        Resource files        Help files        Other file options        Project Files and  Makefiles    PROJNAME .DSW   This is the workspace file used within the development  environment. It organizes all the projects into a single workspace.    PROJNAME .OPT   This is the workspace options file used within the development  environment. It stores all the user options you create for your workspace, so  that each time you open the project workspace it has the look and feel you want  and includes any customizations you have made.    PROJNAME .DSP   This is the project file used within the development  environment. In previous versions of Visual C++ this file extension was MAK. It  stores the information specific to your project. There will be a separate .DSP  file for each project you create. .DSP files are not compatible with NMAKE. You  must export a makefile to build with NMAKE.    PROJNAME .CLW   This file is used by ClassWizard to store information about the  classes in your project    PROJNAME .ODL   This file contains the Object Description Language source code  for a control type library. This file is used by Visual C++ to generate a type  library. The generated library exposes the control\\x92s interface to other  Automation clients.    PROJNAME .NCB&nbsp; This is the No compile Browser file. It contains  information generated by the parser which is used by ClassView, WizardBar, and  Component Gallery. If the file is accidentally or deliberately deleted, it is  automatically regenerated.      README.TXT&nbsp; A file (located in the parent directory of the  project) that describes each file in your project using the actual filenames  created by AppWizard or ControlWizard.     Program or  Control Source and Header Files    PROJNAME .H   This is the main include file for the program or DLL. It  contains all global symbols and  #include  directives for other header  files. It derives the  CPrjnameApp  class from  CWinApp  and  declares an  InitInstance  member function. For a control, the   CPrjnameApp  class is derived from  COleControlModule .    PROJNAME .CPP   This file is the main program source file. It creates one object  of the class  CPrjnameApp  (which is derived from  CWinApp ) and  overrides the  InitInstance  member function.   For executables,  CPrjnameApp::InitInstance  does several  things. It registers document templates, which serve as a connection between  documents and views, creates a main frame window, and creates an empty document  (or opens a document if one is specified as a command-line argument to the  application).   For DLLs and ActiveX (formerly OLE) controls,   CProjNameApp::InitInstance  registers the control\\x92s object factory  with OLE by calling  COleObjectFactory::RegisterAll  and makes a call to   AfxOLEControlInit . In addition, the member function   CProjNameApp::ExitInstance  is used to unload the control from  memory with a call to  AfxOleControlTerm .   This file also registers and unregisters the control in the Windows  registration database by implementing the  DllRegisterServer  and   DllUnregisterServer  functions.    PROJNAME CTL.H,  PROJNAME CTL.CPP   These files declare and implement the  CProjnameCtrl   class.  CProjnameCtrl  is derived from  COleControl , and  skeleton implementations of some member functions are defined that initialize,  draw, and serialize (load and save) the control. Message, event, and dispatch  maps are also defined.    PROJNAME DLG.CPP,  PROJNAME DLG.H   These files are created if you choose a dialog-based  application. The files derive and implement the dialog class, named   CProjnameDlg , and include skeleton member functions to initialize a  dialog and perform dialog data exchange (DDX). Your About dialog class is also  placed in these files instead of in  PROJNAME .CPP.   DLGPROXY.CPP, DLGPROXY.H   in a dialog-based program, these are the implementation and  header file for the project\\x92s Automation proxy class for the main dialog. This  is only used if you have chosen Automation support. This file is one of the  templates provided by MFCAPWZ.DLL.    PROJNAME DOC.CPP,  PROJNAME DOC.H   These files derive and implement the document class, named   CProjnameDoc , and include skeleton member functions to initialize a  document, serialize (save and load) a document, and implement debugging  diagnostics.    PROJNAME SET.H/.CPP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These files are created if you  create a program that supports a database and contains the recordset class.    PROJNAME VIEW.CPP,  PROJNAME VIEW.H   These files derive and implement the view class, named   CProjnameView , that is used to display and print the document data.  The  CProjnameView  class is derived from  CEditView ,   CFormView ,   CRecordView ,   CDaoRecordView ,   CTreeView ,   CListView ,   CRichEditView ,   CScrollView ,  or  CView   and has skeleton member functions to draw the view and implement debugging  diagnostics. If you have enabled support for printing, message-map entries are  added for print, print setup, and print preview command messages. These entries  call the corresponding member functions in the base view class.    PROJNAME PPG.H,  PROJNAME PPG.CPP   These files declare and implement the   CProjnamePropPage  class.  CProjnamePropPage  is derived  from  COlePropertyPage  and a skeleton member function,   DoDataExchange , is provided to implement data exchange and  validation.   IPFRAME.CPP, IPFRAME.H   These files are created if the Mini-Server or Full-Server option  is selected in AppWizard\\x92s Automation Options page (step 3 of 6). The files  derive and implement the in-place frame window class, named   CInPlaceFrame , used when the server is in-place activated by a container  program.   MAINFRM.CPP, MAINFRM.H   These files derive the  CMainFrame  class from either  CFrameWnd   (for SDI applications) or  CMDIFrameWnd   (for MDI applications). The  CMainFrame  class handles the creation of  toolbar buttons and the status bar, if the corresponding options are selected in  AppWizard\\x92s Application Options page (step 4 of 6).    CHILDFRM.CPP, CHILDFRM.H   These files derive the  CChildFrame  class from  CMDIChildWnd .  The  CChildFrame  class is used for MDI document frame windows. These files  are always created if you select the MDI option.      Precompiled Header Files   STDAFX.CPP, STDAFX.H   These files are used to build a precompiled header file   PROJNAME .PCH and a precompiled types file STDAFX.OBJ. It is important  that you neither define nor undefine any of the _AFX_NO_XXX macros in stdafx.h.  See the Knowledge Base article 'PRB: Problems Occur When Defining _AFX_NO_XXX'.  You can find Knowledge Base articles on the MSDN Library CD, or at  http://www.microsoft.com/kb/.      Resource Files    PROJNAME .RC, RESOURCE.H   This is the resource file for the project and its header file.  The resource file contains the default menu definition and accelerator and  string tables for a generic MFC application. It also specifies a default About  box and an icon file (RES\\\\ PROJNAME .ICO). The resource file includes the  file AFXRES.RC for standard Microsoft Foundation class resources. If toolbar  support has been specified as an option, it also specifies the toolbar bitmap  file (RES\\\\TOOLBAR.BMP).    PROJNAME .RC2   The RC2 file can be included at the top of the RC file in a  project.&nbsp; An RC2 file is useful for including resources used by several  different projects.&nbsp; Instead of having to create the same resources several  times for different projects, you can put them in an RC2 file and include the  RC2 file into the main RC file.    PROJNAME .DEF   If the project is for a DLL, this is the module-definition file  for the project. For a control it provides the name and description of the  control, as well as the size of the run-time heap.   RES\\\\ PROJNAME .ICO   This is the icon file for the MFC program or control. This icon  appears when the application is minimized and is also used in the About box.   RES\\\\TOOLBAR.BMP   This bitmap file is used to represent your program or control in  a toolbar or palette. This bitmap is included in the project\\x92s resource  file.&nbsp; The initial toolbar and status bar are constructed in the   CMainFrame  class.      Help File Option   MAKEHELP.BAT   This batch file (located in the parent directory) is provided  only for backward compatibility with older projects. In Visual C++ 6.0, custom  build rules are now attached to the .hpj, .cnt and resource.h files, making  makehelp.bat obsolete.   This file is used to create the help file  PROJNAME .HLP for  your program or control.    PROJNAME .HPJ   This file (located in the parent directory) is the Help project  file used by the Help compiler to create your program or control\\x92s Help  file.    PROJNAME .RTF   This Help file (located in the HLP subdirectory) contains  template topics that you can edit and information on customizing your HPJ  file.    PROJNAME .CNT   This file provides the structure for the  Contents  window  in Windows  Help .   PRINT.RTF   This file, created if printing support is selected (which it is  by default), describes the printing commands and dialog boxes.   BULLET.BMP   This bitmap is used by standard Help file topics to represent  bulleted lists.      Other File Options    PROJNAME .LIC   This is the user license file. This file must be present in the  same directory as the program or DLL to allow an instance of the control to be  created in a design-time environment. Typically, you will distribute this file  with a control, but your customers will not distribute it.    PROJNAME .REG   This file is created in two cases. (1) You have selected any  Automation server option or an Automation option. (2) You have selected a  document file extension (one of the options available in the  Advanced  Options  dialog). The file demonstrates the kind of registration settings the  framework will set for you.   RES\\\\ITOOLBAR.BMP   This file is created only if you have chosen any Automation  server support and have also chosen the  Dockable Toolbar  option. The file  contains tiled images for the toolbar when the server application is in-place  activated inside a container application. The file is similar to the standard  RES\\\\TOOLBAR.BMP except that many nonserver commands are removed.        &nbsp;        \",\n",

       " \"                                 HE'S NOT JESUS CHRIST BUT HE'S GOT THE SAME INITIALS   I've been really busy these past few days, save for the last night where I just sat in a daze in front of the TV for about 4 hours watching episode after episode of season 3 of 'The Family Guy' with the  urlLink new   urlLink roommates  (we try to take a night off from boozing and slutting it up every once in a while to recharge... i'm joking of course, sort of). It was an exhausting weekend.  Before I go into talking about my weekend... about the photo: 'A man was fined nearly 300 dollars for drunk driving a donkey cart in a small South African town and then telling police he was unconcerned 'because the animals knew the way home.'(AFP/POOL/File) ' What an ass!  Last week I mentioned something about my parent's house being haunted. I've got no doubt in my mind that it is. After dinner on friday night I went to use the powder room for things that one does there -- and the light turned off when i was in a very compromising position. Thinking that the lights went off in the rest of the house as well, I grabbed a magazine to cover my junk from the world and ran to the door. It was stuck and i couldnt get it open. I panicked and yelled for my mom like the little bitch i am. I got it opened and to my disbelief, the rest of the house had light. Everything had light, but the bathroom i was in. I touched the light switch and it turned right back on. This ghost hasn't been around the whole time, and if it has, it hasn't been really interested in hanging out with us. But lately it's been racing across the room while my mom is on the phone, making my blind dog bark at the air, and has one hell of a sense of humor, shutting my lights off as I sit on the can. My aunt thinks it's a friendly ghost. You can buy shit from my parents' ghostly  urlLink garage sale  this weekend.  Saturday I went out with my mom, aunt, and my cousins who are about 11 and 16. My little cousins are so fucking awesome... i'm stoked to be related to them. My cousin Renee is a gorgeous little girl who looks like a supermodel mixed with an Olsen Twin. She's 11 and short for her age, but stylish as hell. She was wearing this pin striped pair of pants, black chuck taylors, a layered top, and a blazer. I was like 'Whoa, you look like you're in the Strokes!' her older brother, Eric (16), said 'yeah, that's the look she's going for.'   We went to H&M and then I took Eric to Search & Destroy -- which he totally dug, but didnt get anything, and then we went to Urban Outfitters (dont front like you dont go there too... I know you do).   The Streets' 'Fit But You Know It' is totally fucking Blur's 'Parklife.' How fucking fun!   Anyway, Saturday night I made my way to  urlLink Misshapes  hear  urlLink Audrey  DJ amazingly, and to dance with Lizzy,  urlLink Niki ,  urlLink Marc , and  urlLink Greg &Raphael. Check out  urlLink Me and the Boyfriends .   urlLink Andy  found himself cornered by me so I could ask him details about the logistics of beheading a person. This sent Greg packing and made me thirsty for more knowledge. The best thing about having a friend like Andy, other then him being awesome, is that he's got this vast knowledge about science and medicine and can explain things to me in the most laymen of terms. He's like the indie rock Stephen Hawkins for retards like myself who like to ... uh... lay-men.  It's weird. A few months ago I would get quickly exhausted from partying. I found myself crawling back home at midnight the latest to find my bed and fall asleep. I guess with the weather being better I'm able to find myself crawling home at after 4am these days... which I did on saturday night with Andy,  urlLink Brian , and a few of their friends. We didn't go home as much as we went to the new club on Delancey called The Delancey. We tried to get in cause we heard there was an open bar, and found ourselves out of luck with a doorman wearing ill-advised leather pants. I never saw this dude's face cause he was like, 39 feet tall. So Andy and his lady friends walked me home as the sun was rising.  Sunday night I went to the  urlLink Trash  party so i could DJ for the party kids. I really love DJing... it's like the most fun a person could have sometimes. I think I got really drunk tho, cause I remember straight lines were a joke, and I remember having a conversation with someone and having to keep my eyes closed (which hopefully made me look a bit pensive) so they wouldn't cross and give me a headache. I've been to Don Hills twice in the past month for the first time in ages, and both times, there were dancing half-naked people. Oy Vey. My parent's at least could breathe a sigh of relief that I wasn't one of those dancing-half-naked people. Not that there's anything wrong with it...   When I was sober during the night I got to see Jess' new band called Americana and was fully impressed. There's something there for sure. A mix of Smiths and a bit of Emo... it was right up my alley. Jess has the looks and charm that a frontman needs and I'm gonna keep a steady eye on these guys.  Monday it started pouring outside. I had invited some friends over a few days earlier promising a  BBQ with lots of yummy food, but suddenly it didn't look like it was gonna happen. So me and the girls decided to cut our losses, tell people not to come over when they called to see if it was still on, and stick all the food in our fridge save for a few beers and some food that we were gonna cook up for ourselves. Needless to say, everyone figured that rain couldn't hold 3A down and showed up. We found an indoor grill and cooked up almost all the food we bought. Sorry to anyone i told to not come. We're gonna have a .. um.. rain date. I manned the grill, by the way, and made some killer chicken.  Yesterday morning my brain was fucked. I had spent the past three days partying and was really super tired. I found myself in Long Island interviewing a former member of a boyband who shall remain nameless (there's a clue to his itentity in the title of this blog posting) in his hotel room, and then later in his bus. The Singer (who will be called TS from here on out) and I got off on the wrong foot, arguing about race car drivers. He told me that some drivers could make up to $200 Million A YEAR. Yeah, you read that number right. So my thought was 'I don't see why they don't just quit racing after they take home that $200 million dollar paycheck.' This statement launched TS into a total ghetto accent that was so over the top, it was a parody of itself:  Me: 'I don't see why they don't just quit racing after they take home that $200 million dollar paycheck.' TS: 'When it's what you know, you do it.'  Me: 'Well, fine, but it seems unnecessary to keep it up if you're bringing home a check like that. All you need is one check and you're set for life.' TS: 'They're just doing what they know. They can't help it. It's what they know.' Me: 'Well, they should get to know something else. Something less life-threatening.' TS: (getting a bit hostile) 'What's they supposed to do? Be an accountant?' Me: (getting annoyed) 'No, that's the point! They don't need a job. They can chill out. Hang out with their family. Go traveling.' TS: 'Not when racing is all you know. You gonna tell a pilot to get a different job when all they know is flying?' Me: 'If I knew a pilot who brought home a $200 Million paycheck for one year of work, yes, I would tell him that.'  TS: 'Well, it's all they know.'  According to the former member of a popular boyband that is possibly no longer together but features a member who went out with a popstar who is now looking like she had too many days snorting oxycontin, race car drivers aren't very faceted.          \",\n",

       " \"                                 Old Brains  Can Learn New Tricks       A study led by the Rotman Research  Institute at Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care in Toronto has found that older  adults can perform just as well as young adults on visual, short-term memory  tests. What's remarkable, however, is that older adults use different areas of  the brain than younger people.      The study, in conjunction with the  University of Toronto and Brandeis University in Massachusetts, is to be  published in the Oct. 25th international journal Current Biology. While other  studies have conducted comparisons of young and old brain activity, this is the  first to focus on how the interplay of brain regions relates to cognitive  functioning and aging.      'The older brain is more resilient than  we think,' says Dr. Randy McIntosh, Rotman scientist and assistant professor,  Department of Psychology, at University of Toronto. 'If aging brains can find  ways to compensate for cognitive decline, this could have exciting implications  for memory rehabilitation.'      Ten young adults (ages 20 to 30) and  nine older adults (ages 60 to 79) participated in identical visual, short-term  memory tests while their brain activity was measured using positron emission  tomography (PET). PET measures regional cerebral blood and acts as a marker to  show which brain areas are lighting up during a memory performance task.       Participants were shown pairs of  vertical grid patterns on a computer screen and asked to select which one had  the higher spatial frequency. After viewing each pair, they would press one of  two keys to indicate the correct grid. Researchers measured their ability to  discriminate stimuli over half-second and four-second intervals.      Results show that young and older  participants perform the memory task equally well, but the neural systems or  pathways supporting performance differed between young and older individuals.  While there was some overlap in the brain regions supporting performance (e.g.  occipital, temporal and inferior prefrontal cortices), the neural communication  among these common regions was much weaker in older individuals.      Older individuals compensated for this  weakness by recruiting unique areas of the brain, including hippocampus and  dorsal prefrontal cortices. Scientists are most fascinated by the older brain's  activation of the hippocampus because this area is generally used for more  complicated memory tasks such as learning lines from a Shakespeare play.       Dr. McIntosh was assisted in the study  by Dr. Allison Sekuler, Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, and her  father Dr. Robert Sekuler at Brandeis University.      Funding for the study was provided by  the Alzheimer's Association of America, the Natural Sciences and Engineering  Research Council of Canada, and Medical Research Council of Canada.

       " \"                                 Seeing through it all   I just got back from doing my laps at the pool.  I did something today while swimming that I've never done before.  I looked around.  It started somewhere around lap 32, I looked forward and realized that I'd never seen the pool from that angle.  I was so used to looking down and following the blue line painted on the bottom of the pool, afraid that if I didn't I might swim diagonally and cause some awful fender-bender in the pool.  So I'm looking ahead, and I see the water for the first time.  I notice how incredibly blue it is, how clear it is, I can see the far end of the pool.  Then I notice the light, and how beautiful the light reflects the ripples on the bottom of the pool.  And  then  I notice how fast I'm going.. haha.  I feel power and control over my motions.  I feel confidence.  Sure there's a bunch of guys swimming faster than me, but I'm swimming faster than myself, faster than I've ever been able to.  I feel myself start to smile.  A few laps later I'm still enjoying looking around, and that's when I start to notice the people.  They're all regulars, one's that I've seen dozens of times, but I've never given them much thought.  First I notice this older lady swimming in the lane to my right, next to the wall.  She's nearly 80.  But she's here everyday.  She slowly swims her mile then quietly leaves.  I never see her smile to or talk to anyone.  She's just there enjoying the water.  I don't think I've ever been here without her swimming.  I slow down, pondering what her story might be.  Did she grow up swimming, and it reminds her of her childhood?  Was she jilted by a lover, or lost her greatest love, and swimming is all there is to take her mind away?  No, I think it just makes her feel better.  Not just the exercise, but the peace that comes from the inherent silence the water brings.    Which brings us to old-suitcase-man.  Suitcase man comes to the pool everyday.  He must be 75, he comes in everyday wearing these gawdawful green speedos and a swim cap, towing this wheeled travel case behind him into the pool area.  Same thing everyday.  He walks up and says something to the lifeguard on duty (doesn't matter which one).  She laughs awkwardly, and he walks away.  Puts his suitcase by the door and climbs down the stairs into the deep end.  Today suitcase decides to talk to the old lady swimmer, she doesn't respond well to it.  He mumbles something and then dives back under.  Old man starts his little swim routine.  A few moments later, the old lady comes back the shallow end of the pool and climbs out.  I don't think she likes him much.  Then old-suitcase-man stays in the deep end for about 5 minutes, doing what I can only describe as 'diving for hidden treasure.'  Because there was nothing to be found, that I could see.  He was over-and-over diving to the bottom, doing somersaults and coming back up for air.  I started to wonder if he might be some treasure-hunter like jac Cousteau or something.  He comes to the Lubbock YWCA to train for deep-sea diving, and to stay in practice with his suave repertoire' with the ladies.  Anyways, he didn't stay long, about 10 minutes total, then he leaves.  I get the feeling that he's really lonely, and that most of what he does is to show up.  From the hiddentreasure diving to the suitcase and the green speedos.  I feel for him.    There's a lot more people that I could talk about.  Each more eccentric than the last.  But I just realized how long this post was getting.  I will say that my swimming seems to be getting better every week.  Today was the fourth time in a row that I've swam 50 laps.  That's 2/3 of a mile.  It's my new minimum.  I will never do less than that, no matter what my excuse is.  Once I start doing it a little faster I'll probably move up to a mile each time.  My ultimate goal is 2 miles in and hour.  And then I'll hold it there.  Then I'll start working on running and bicycling.  Laura and I are planning to enter an iron-man competition sometime early next year.   --Will                 \",\n",
       " \"                                 Seventeen feels a LOT like sixteen, although maybe ever so slightly more itchy. Last night I had a shindig with some amigos, it was a good time. Nate was unable to make it but was awesome about it and gave me a call while at work, which was cool. I think the highlight for me was the full reading of Howl (although it was probably more fun to read than to listen) while drinking the non-alcoholic wine. In general I was touched by the kindness of my friends, bringing all kinds of things with them and even gifts ( Yeah, so did your girlfriend get you a hemp necklace and a T-shirt with a  dreaded smiley face? . No, I didn't think so. Shut down.) It was kind of funny though because it honestly didn't occur to me that they were gifts, it only dawned on me later. Anyway, thank you amigos for your compassion and generosity, I can safely say *seven year old voice* This is the best whiteyversary  ever !   But what went on? First of all I bickered with my parents and they dutifully informed me that they had just decided I can only have one person in the car at a time, so I took the car and picked Nick up, we went and snagged a copy of Almost Famous at Blockbuster and came back to my house, and chilled out for a while until everyone else showed up. We then ate hamburgers which really sucked for some reason. I didn't overcook them though, despite the misinformed posse's assumptions, because hamburgers need that. There is a big blank, and then the poetry reading, and then another big blank and writing ' Fuck tha Police' on our chests ( I was Tha) with lipstick, and then Nick and Andrew got their nails painted, there was a discussion on how to marinate a baby (I say that a little garlic, lemon, oregano and sicilian olive oil would get the furthest) and a discussion on global politics, and glow stick wars, and I tackled Owen and took him down, and then another blank and chilling out with Liz and Laura at my table and playing with a glow stick in my mouth ( Mandiblshe of def!) and then I must have gone to bed. And now, because I am bored, I will fill out this long and irrelevant survey.   1) Using band names, spell out your name.  J -&nbsp; Jimi Hendrix  U – U2  S - Sublime  T – the Beatles  I - Incubus  N – Norah Jones   2) Have you ever had a song written about you?: Nope  3) What song makes you cry?: Well I don’t really –cry- at songs in the wailing sobbing sense, but I get tears at a couple. Little Wing by Jimi Hendrix, Scar Tissue by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Any John Frusciante (although I can’t explain why)   4) What song makes you happy?: Don’t get me started. This instant – Concrete Jungle by Bob Marley because it’s such bloody genius.  5) What do you like to listen to before bed? I don’t listen to music before I go to bed because it screws up my meditation and then I can’t sleep.   a p p e a r a n c e  HEIGHT: 6ish  HAIR COLOR: brown  SKIN COLOR: caucasian  EYE COLOR: blue  PIERCINGS: none  TATTOOS: none yet  r i g h t - n o w  WHAT COLOR PANTS ARE YOU WEARING?: Blue striped pajamas  WHAT SONG ARE YOU LISTENING TO OR WATCHING?: Concrete Jungle by Marley  TASTE IS IN YOUR MOUTH?: really strong tea  WHAT'S THE WEATHER LIKE?: sort of overcast  HOW ARE YOU?: wonderful!  &nbsp;d o - y o u  GET MOTION SICKNESS?: not normally, but sometimes when sailing  HAVE A BAD HABIT?: Maybe a couple  GET ALONG WITH YOUR PARENTS?: Very well. Lately we argue about driving (cause I want to, and they don’t want me to basically) but I couldn’t even imagine insulting or yelling at my parents.   f a v o r i t e s  TV SHOW: Don’t watch much  &nbsp;TVMAGAZINE: Adbusters, in spite of having only looked at the pictures  SODA: don’t like it so much, but sprite I would say.  THING TO DO ON THE WEEKEND: Write, read, sleep, dream, hallucinate, talk, jam, etc. etc.  h a v e - y o u  BROKEN THE LAW: not really, on anything important at least  RAN AWAY FROM HOME: Ok, when you live in the woods where I do, running away doesn’t really look like an option. As a kid, if you have any common sense, you know that the wolves will get you before you ever reach the highway. And even if you do get to the highway, you’ve still got a long walk before you hit civilization. So apologizing for whatever you did and sucking it is often more appealing than running away. Short answer – no.  SNUCK OUT OF THE HOUSE: same reason as above. Where would I go? I suppose now I can drive, but before it would have been really stupid cause then I’d just be walking around my neighborhood.  EVER GONE SKINNY DIPPING: not yet  MADE A PRANK PHONE CALL: nope  EVER TIPPED OVER A PORTA POTTY: no  USED YOUR PARENTS' CREDIT CARD BEFORE: No  SKIPPED SCHOOL BEFORE: oh yeah  FELL ASLEEP IN THE SHOWER/BATH: no  BEEN IN A SCHOOL PLAY: Yes. Let us speak no more of this.  LET A FRIEND CRY ON YOUR SHOULDER: emotionally? Yeah. Physically? I don’t think so. EVER HAD A MAJOR REGRET: it’s going to sound like I’m lying, but no. I don’t really regret anything I’ve done. I’ve done plenty of things wrong but I’ve always done the best I could do, and it’s all led me to where I am today (which is a very lucky and wonderful position) and so I have no major regrets.  &nbsp;l o v e  BOYFRIEND: I’ve got a couple   GIRLFRIEND: I’ve got a Liz, if that’s what you mean.  CHILDREN: tons of illegitimate kiddies running around, in all corners of the globe  BEEN IN LOVE?: Ok, random tangent. I think I’ve been in love my whole life, since I was born. I think I fall in love ten or twelve times a day, with people and songs and moments and ideas and politics and spirits and poems. I know I’ve loved people sincerely and unromantically and that I do love people like that right now, and I’m beginning to wonder if there’s a difference between that love and romantic love (which is somehow special and different I guess). I am answering this question yes, because I have been in love my whole life, in one way or the other. Isn’t love just love? Do we really have to classify and organize and rank it? Can one love mean more than another love? I don’t know anything other than I am full of love, whatever kind it is.  HAD A HARD TIME GETTING OVER SOMEONE: no.  BEEN HURT?: Everybody has.  YOUR GREATEST REGRET?: I don’t know.   GONE OUT WITH A SOMEONE YOU ONLY KNEW FOR 3 DAYS: Yeah I think so.  r a n d o m  DO YOU HAVE A JOB: No  YOUR CD PLAYER HAS IN IT RIGHT NOW: Copious amounts of Marley, old coffeehouse CD, Led Zeppelin IV, and my new Beat Poetry readings.  IF YOU WERE A CRAYON, WHAT COLOR WOULD YOU BE?: Awesome colored, obviously.  WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?: A lot of things. Big things like friends and family and freedom and music and Buddhism and all that sort of thing, and really little things like a cup of tea in the morning and a place to sleep at night, and walking with bare feet.  WHO MAKES YOU THE HAPPIEST?: Everybody makes me happy.  WHAT'S THE NEXT CD YOU'RE GONNA GET?: I don’t really buy many   CDs WHO DO YOU CONSIDER GOOD FRIENDS?: &nbsp;All my friends are good friends.  w h e n / w h a t - w a s - t h e - l a s t  TIME YOU CRIED?: full out? Quite a while ago, probably two or three years  YOU GOT A REAL LETTER:? I got a birthday card in the mail, does that count?  YOU GOT E-MAIL: yesterday  TV PROGRAM YOU WATCHED: the Daily Show with Jon Stewart  MOVIE YOU SAW AT THE THEATER: The Terminal  y o u r - t h o u g h t s - o n  ABORTION:&nbsp;We have no right to tell a woman what she can and can’t do with her own body. Abortion is never nice, but sometimes it can be the right thing to do.  TEENAGE SMOKING: teenage smokers grow up into adult smokers, who die of cancer.  SPICE GIRLS: who?  SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE: I don’t see how a marriage license and a church changes something from being wrong to right, but that’s just my opinion. I think everybody needs to make up their own minds, and I have an immense amount of respect for the people who have the discipline to be celibate (in general, not just before marriage).  DOWNLOADING MUSIC ILLEGALLY: sure, although I dislike the fact that musicians don’t get the money. But with the state of affairs in the music industry today, I wouldn’t mind fifty cent having to sell a car or two. Besides, I only download dead people’s music.       \",\n",

       " \"                                 This series  WILL BE AMAZING .  The storylines are endless . First, there is the obvious.  Larry Brown vs Rick Carlisle . There will be a lot of people that want Carlisle to win because they think he was unjustly kicked out of Detroit. Those people didn't sit through two seasons with a coach that refused to take Michael Curry out of the starting lineup. A coach that was  FORCED BY JOE DUMARS  to try Tayshaun Prince in the Magic series. A coach that would not listen to ANYBODY. A coach that did not make adjustments at any time. A coach that once let Ricky Davis go off for almost 50 before he sent a single double team at him, and allowed the same with Shareef Abdur-Rahim. All this being said, he has to have an advantage. He coached this team for the past two years and knows the ins and outs of every player on the roster. I appreciate what Carlisle did for the Pistons, but I know as a fan living 45 minutes from Detroit there were many people questioning his decision making during the two years. Most people thought that the 50 wins would get him off the hook. If it weren't for Larry Brown, Carlisle would be coaching the Pistons vs the Pacers anyways. He would just be on the other side.  Then we will move to the fact that  Ben Wallace deserved to 3-peat as Defensive Player of the Year, and that PISSES HIM OFF . Would you want Ben pissed at you? Ron Artest will try to prove that he is the best defensive player in the league. But here's the thing... will he be covering Tayshaun Prince ? Because, if he is,  the best player in the league should not be wasted covering Tayshaun Prince .Ben Wallace will be busy covering the ENTIRE PACER TEAM. That is exactly why he should have been voted Defensive Player of the Year.  Next there is  Jermaine Oneal versus the BIG MEN of the Pistons . The good news for the Pistons is that it's 2 vs 1. The bad news is that ONE killed us the first 3 meetings of the year. Jermaine was the MVP of the Eastern Conference, and could have been the MVP of the entire league. This should be a very intriguing match-up. I feel that Jermaine will get his. But, he must be contained if the Pistons are to win the series.    Reggie Miller vs Rip Hamilton . Maybe this one doesn't sound quite as compelling. But lets look at it this way. Reggie was once in Rip's shoes. He was running through screens trying to tire the whole opponent's roster out while leading his team offensively. He was once the skinny little kid that didn't get the respect he deserved. Reggie once was in Michael's shadow. Rip is emerging. In fact, he has even showed that he is increasing his range. Rip is looking to lead his team to the Finals, just as Reggie did years ago.   Jamaal Tinsley vs Chauncey Billups . This sounds to most as a complete white-wash. But, don't forget that Jamaal Tinsley has been trying to prove himself since the day he got into the NBA. In fact, he had to prove he was more than a street baller ever since he stepped on the floor at Iowa State. Players like this should never be underestimated. The Pistons need to win this match-up. Jamaal has worked on his 3-point shot. Chauncey will need to get out on him. Chauncey will hit a game winner in this series.   Corliss Williamson and the Pistons Bench vs the EXTREMELY TALENTED PACER'S BENCH . At first glance this looks like a complete blowout. But come playoff time the contributions will be more than just point production. The Pistons once had the bench that was considered the best in the NBA. Now that distinction goes to the Pacer's bench mob. Al Harrington is the most talented bench player possibly in league history, and I am being serious. Two years ago Corliss Williamson scored 14 fourth quarter points to lead the Pistons to a win in Indiana. With a couple minutes to go he gave Jermaine Oneal the facial of a lifetime. The next possession he got fouled hard by Oneal and then threw a fastball off of Jermaine's head from about 3 feet. This may be forgotten by most, I doubt it was forgotten by Corliss and Jermaine. Big Nasty will need to score in this series, as will Mehmet Okur. Don't forget about the guys like Mike James, Lindsey Hunter, Anthony Johnson, and Austin Croshere. These guys will have a big impact on who wins this series. The Indiana point guards will have a hard time when James and Hunter are in the game. They pressure the ball better than any other guard duo in the entire NBA.  This series is going to come down to who makes shots and stops when they need to. The Pistons are going to have players like Rasheed Wallace and Chauncey Billups hitting big 3's in the 4th quarter. The Pacers are going to need stops out of players like Jermaine Oneal and Ron Artest. This is going to be a long, hard fought series. This series will be the best series of the playoffs. I don't care if the scores are 75-74. The effort level will be amazing.  FEAR THE FRO .  Ben Wallace will be the difference, Pistons in 6 or 7.          \",\n",

Unit tests are the lifeblood of a good Test Driven Development approach (and thus, are also the lifeblood of most of the agile methodologies out there such as XP, Scrum and others). Therefore it stands to reason that one should strive to create unit tests with the least amount of work and maintenance, which will in turn allow the developer to focus on the business problem at hand and the various design and algorithms needed to create a working product/component.        &nbsp;    For the past couple of years I?ve been struggling with Unit tests, That is, I?ve used them in major production projects and have seen the good and the bad that can come from a fully test Driven approach. I?ll let the ?good? part be taken care of by the numerous other articles out there that talk about the benefits you get from Unit Tests and TDD, and will focus on one of the most problematic parts of Unit tests in a real world project ? testing against the database.        &nbsp;    Testing Data Access layer components (DALs for short) is problematic in a number of ways. The number one reason f is this:        &nbsp;    Testing the various CRUD(Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on a single class can result in a massive amount of ?garbage? data residing on the test database (You  are  using a test database, aren?t you?). This creates several problems:         1.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Problem: Garbage Data         Your database will eventually be full of junk data which you?ll need to get rid of sooner or later        &nbsp;       2.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Problem: Affecting other tests         Worst, you may break one of the golden rules of unit testing:&nbsp;  No test should be dependent on another test to perform correctly . That is, you should be able to run your tests in  any  order you choose or maybe just one of them at a time, and they should all still work. That means that every test needs to start with a known state on which it will act. For DALs this usually means a known state of records in the database.       But guess what? When you test CRUD operations you?re actually changing the state of the database, so the next test that will be run that might depend on a specific record being there might fail because you just deleted that record in your current test. Anything can happen.        &nbsp;       3.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Problem: starting tests from a known state         This is the other side of the previous problem: My test needs to have something in the database in order to perform correctly. For example ? it needs a specific ?category? entity in the Category tables in order to test inserting a child ?Product? into the Products table. I need to make sure I insert these values into the database before I perform the test, but I also want to make sure that data is no longer there after I finish my test.        &nbsp;    Dealing with the problems      So how do you deal with all this garbage data that?s making your database and tests unstable? Obviously, you need to make sure that before and after each test you leave the database in the same state that you got it in. That is ? you need to ?undo? your CRUD operations after testing them. Here are some of the most prevalent methods used to achieve this.....      &nbsp;            ',\n",

Ideas forming in my mind         Like wild flowers growing in a garden            As I walk toward the computer.

Suddenly, it comes on with a touch of a         Button,            For it spoke with a gruff voice,            Scaring me half to death         As if it is ready to jump out at of me,            Like a tiger hunting his prey.        Reaching out for the mouse,         Moving about all over the blue screen.

Yelling like a banshee who has gone mad.        Hearing a little, gentle voice trying to         Calm me down as I was wiping my tears         away from my red,         Flushed face quickly.            Smiling sweetly at him,         Trying to hide my emotions         “Don’t play with me, missy,”        Acting all innocent and cute,         “Come on missy, I saw your lip.”        “What is that lying on floor, playing         Dead?”        He said looking at me.            Finally, braking down and telling him         Everything that had happened to me.         Taking my hand and placing it in his.            Whispering softly,        “Cheer up, everything will be alright.            Hush now, I am here.”                 This poem talks about the challenges that everyone with and without disabilities has to face in life.    No matter who you are, everybody has challenges.

       " '                                &nbsp;  Spring Clean Your Life   by Kathy Gates   Our minds are much like our homes. They both get cluttered with old ideas,  old attitudes, old conversations, old hurts. Both need a routine cleaning out of  stuff that we collected for one reason, and are holding onto out of habit,  neglect, or just sheer willfulness.    Pursuing a simple, sustainable, flexible, happier lifestyle means that you  have to choose it. And that means choosing to lose some other things. It means  getting rid of things that no longer work for you, it means updating the way you  do things, it means freeing up some space for new and exciting opportunities and  challenges.    Just like cleaning your home, a mental Spring Cleaning takes a dedicated  effort, a conscious choice to make changes in your mind the same way you make  changes in your décor.    Here are some ideas to get you started on a Spring Cleaning for your Life:     1. Clean out the anger, hatred, jealousy, and self doubt. If you need to  apologize, bit the bullet and do it. If you\\x92re still angry and waiting on an  apology from someone who won\\x92t or can\\x92t give you one, decide to let it go. It\\x92s  not contributing to your life - in fact it\\x92s contaminating it - so it needs to  go to the junk heap at the curb. Only then can you put something POSITIVE in  it\\x92s place. Make some room for happiness.    2. Wash away delay and procrastination. Delay and procrastination set you up  for frustration after frustration. You\\x92ll find yourself constantly in the past,  trying to catch up, scrambling around trying not to get caught. Is that really  how you want to live? Get into the present! You\\x92re missing your life by living  yesterday over and over.    3. Dust off your attitude, and put on a fresh coat of positive. A positive  attitude begins with gratitude. For just one day, practice giving instead of  taking, practice sharing as much love, help, care, concern, and gratitude as  possible. It\\x92ll change your perspective.    4. Throw out misunderstanding, and lack of patience. Sweep out the dirt of  gossip or lies. Open the shades and let in the warmth of friendship. True  friendships, take work, time, energy, thoughtfulness. True friendships require  forgiveness, require understanding. You don\\x92t want to be a doormat to anyone,  but you do want to find relationships that are equal and reciprocal. The results  are certainly worth it.    5. Lighten up your thoughts with humor and fun. Yes life is difficult and the  world can be a scary, tiresome place. But in your own world, you are in charge  of every day. You decide what to think about. You decide when to laugh, you  decide what to read, what to listen to, what to think about. Choose to insert  laughter into each day; choose to have a little fun every day.    6. Open the windows of your mind to new ideas and a fresh perspective on  living a happier, better, easier life. Change takes action. There\\x92s no silver  bullet, no magic pill. But if you\\x92ll open your mind to some different ways of  doing things, if you\\x92ll try some new habits, if you\\x92ll work your mind muscles  and your organizational skills in a different way, you\\x92ll find that you\\x92ll  create the life that you truly want, not just the one that you end up with.    7. Enjoy the person you are. If you don\\x92t like yourself, find out why, and  start working on becoming a person you do enjoy and that others will enjoy also.  The returns will be worth it.

Read on for our continued  discussion on Correlational Opponent Theory.             &gt;&gt; Damn you and your damn  theory!       *teehee*...this is a topic that  my brain has been chewing on for about 10 years....glad to see it is causing  someone ELSE to 'lose some sleep'       &gt;&gt;Ever since you told me you  believe that each person simply 'reacts' to his/her surroundings, I've been  watching people, and thinking hard for some evidence it's not true. And so far,  I haven't found it - But - I still haven't found any evidence to disprove my  preferable theory that we are unique, blah blah....       AHH Yes, and that is the beauty  of this 'Little' theory - I have not been able to debunk it so far..however nor  have I really been able to PROVE it 'beyond a shadow'...thats what the whole  Co-OpTheory Worksheet is for - trying to formalize the idea and get any wrinkles  in the logic ironed out with some factual (albeit mathematical)  data.       &gt;&gt;Unique in appearance -  there is no question there. Unique in mind, well - yes - I believe that (tho I'm  still considering the development of the mind [in relation to experiences] as  people grow from being a little toddler) - unique in behaviour - well, I would  say yes also, if I didn't see so many people behaving in extremely predictable  ways every day. I could argue that one's determination to think for themselves  creates individuality and uniqueness....But the rebuttal to that would be that  throughout the course of that person's life, they have been exposed to  situations, or attitudes that have given them the attitude towards  thinking.       Well, this is a much more  complex thought process than initially it seems....MY Argument is that human  behaviour is a systematic respose to the current input stimuli that the Human  receives COMBINED with ALL of the responses to ALL PREVIOUS inputs to the  system....In this way, the 'Learned', 'Programmed' or 'Aquired' behavioural  mechanisms that humans develop are essentially the 'Least amount of change  required' to make their output (actions/Behaviours) EQUALLY OPPOSE the combined  inputs (and learned adjustments to those inputs from the past)..our basic  motivation then becomes Laziness..'What is the least amount of work  (output/action I have to take) I have to do in order to balance this  equation:       Current Inputs + Behaviour =  Sum of all Inputs and outputs provided to the system over  time       _IF_ perchance, my past actions  created an internal 'Engram' that means NEXT time the same scenario comes around  I don't see it as being 'out of the ordinary' or interesting (i.e If the value  of my brainwaves PLUS the input scenario is CLOSE to what I remember) then the  input can be considered fully learned...How then, can we 'LEARN' behaviour's in  such a way that we exhibit 'Unique' personal behaviours? Easy...when we  encounter the input stimuli, something ELSE (other than the INPUT and our  OUTPUT) 'unbalances' the system...for instance, if a parent ADD's input the a  baby's 'Processor' during and after the presentation of an input then the INPUT  will NOT equal the memory encoded in the baby's brain and therefore the scenario  becomes 'Interesting' to the baby and the baby's mind encodes the difference  between the input and the expected value back into the system so that next time  the memory is closer to the inputs...       Which leads to your next  comment really well:       &gt;&gt;Raising a child will  provide some decent evidence one way or another towards this topic - how they  learn, what they learn for themselves and why - for example - I have a cousin  who is a couple of years old - he can open and close sliding glass doors, and  understands that getting his fingers jammed would be bad - yet he has never  jammed his fingers..... (I don't know if this is something his parents tried to  teach him...)       YES..Spot on!...{maybe Kat and  I should get onto the baby-making-bandwagon and 'Build' ourselves our very own  Human-AI experiment *LOL*}...i am actually looking forwad to Fatherhood partly  for this (not exact) reason..i think I understand the complexity of the layering  of learned experience enough to be a 'Useful' father...also though, because the  system is LOGARITHMICALLY complex (i.e. a previous learned response cannot be  undone, it must be 'learned out' and the 'Whole of Brain' experiece is fully  encoded - Every input and response EVER EXPERIENCED is incoded in the brain  engram all at the same time)..i am aware that it is a pretty oenerous task and  MY Mistakes compound once they are learned by my child......       The Sliding door  conundrum.....not so hard to explain....TWO bits to it:       Going back to ...'Least amount  of change required' to make their output (actions/Behaviours) EQUALLY OPPOSE the  combined inputs'... If the inputs to this 'feedback loop' include metrics such  as current amount of pain, current amount of force being exerted as WELL as  visual cues such as the location of the child's hand in relation to other  objects, velocity of the door etc... then this whole 'least amount of  resistance' theory covers this learned behaviour by trying to balance the  _potential_ for pain (or bad experience) with the current siutation...However,  The child must have been made aware of their own mortality for this all to work.  At some point the input to the system (Pain, blood, shouting at by mum and dad)  increased above the 'remembered' value and caused a learning experience....this  learning experience then gets 'reused' in different scenarios..HOW?...well you  see this whole process exhibits a sort of INERTIA....like this: Child puts hand  near something (other than a door) MUM or DAD yells at them to stop (protecting  them from hurting themselves) and the Input stuation now does not match what the  child expects (an INTERESTING situation occurs) so the child learns to expect  shouting when their hand nears something...next time mum and dad DON't yell  (situation is not dangerous)..this in turn Becomes an INTERESTING situation  because the child was expecting to be shouted at when their hand goes near  something but weren't (and, as such their inputs don't match their  memory)....they Un-Learn the hand/shout scenario a little bit...this naturally  encodes the 'Middle ground' between the two scenarios and, unknowingly, has  encoded the same situation with varying inputs as a Safe/Not Safe engram....As  soon as the child goes to touch something and doesn't get shouted at, they LEARN  the situation to be safe (because there was no shouting and the inputs _still_  do not exactly match the memory). In this way, although MUM &amp; DAD did not  'Teach' the 'Doors can hurt your hand' Meme to the child, they have learned the  process for evaulating safe stuations because they were told about an unsafe one  (I think that all makes sense)....THIS DOES NOT WORK IF THE CHILD HAS NOT FELT  PAIN! - if the child has not felt pain then there is no difference between the  inputs of:        * the child's hand touching a  HOT item that could hurt them (or sharp-hurty door)       * the child's hand touching a  soft cushion that could not       If there is no difference in  these two inputs from the child's point of view then there could be no  learning...thus we can prove that in order for this theory to work, a feedback  allowing data about the Host/Human/Child/Robot needs to be included as an input  to the system...which is ok because this is exactly what humans have - 5 RAW  sensory inputs (Smell, touch, taste, sight sound) plus multiple internal inputs  (heart rate, temperature, pain, emotive response, hunger  etc).       Secondly (an briefly coz this  is oficcially a long-winded email now), various regions of the brain are used  for differnet tasks and trained specifically for those tasks accordingly..the  various different areas of the brain are then 'Joined' together (at the Mendula  Oblongata) and the total output is sent down the spinal cord to complete the  feedback loop (action is taken, the response from the action is the next input  value..e.g turn your head, the visual [and audio] input changes, potentially  producing an output). Over time, (and continuously over our life), sections of  the brain become increasingly and slowly diconnected from each other.... At a  time near conception, our brains are almost 'fully connectionist' that is; each  neuron is (almost) connected to every other neuron in the brain, therefore the  brain is completely aware of the other bits of the brain....as time goes by  (rapidly when young, slowly as we get older) connections between nerons are  'dropped' this results in sections of the brain becoming diconnected from other  sections at least partially. The effect of this is that sections of the brain  that are 'Trained' to respond to certain inputs no longer have the 'Complete'  view of the world that they used to and are required to provide an output based  upon on the 'partial picture' of the world that it has....when many sections  make 'Guesses' like this, it results in novel reponses that still are applicable  to the scenario they are in response to but based upon incomplete or inaccurate  data and, therefore NOT QUITE RIGHT' which we see as being 'Creative' or 'Novel'  thought....this is kinda like the 'Tower Of Babel' story of how 'God' introduced  the Languagfe Barrier (Different languages did not exist in th ebible before  this time) overnight in order to stop humans building a tower all the way to  heaven...the brain, after some initial training in the 'one big same  language'...suddenly starts speaking different dialects in different areas and  cant fully understand the dialect of other areas...this results in a kinda  neural 'chinese whispers' which we see as Creativity or uniqueness - hrmm maybe  this is a good name for creative thought (Neural Chinese  whispers)...       (Also links between neurons  that have no direct link to the outside world are created over time in the brain  ...that is, one part of the brain may take its input from the output of another  part of the brain...so these decision making links are heirarchical not  flat!)       Soooo, from 3 simple theorys  (Co-Op theory + Neural Learning + Disconnectionist evolution) we get  intelligence and creative thought....       The next question is, how does  this apply to evolution?        Could, over time, our  physiology change so that certain areas of the brain are pre-connected (or  pre-disconnected) from each other to produce a more efficent brain? - is this  what happened between Homo Sapiens (neanderthal man) and Homo Sapien-Sapiens  (Human man)??       Could, over time, the 'Driver  Signal' used to start this 'wave theory thing I have going' (in this case the  28Hz driver signal on the Excel worksheet) be customized to pre-contain data on  it rather than being a blank driver signal...could, perhaps, we be copied with  the waveform (or part of) that our parent/mother has and, therefore, could we be  born with A Priori knowledge of the world?...the answer would seem at first look  to be YES - after all, we are exactly the same biological species as our  ancestors but we are 'Smarter' or seem to be because we 'Know more about  more'..we 'remember' what our ancestors learned to some degree...now, sure, some  of this is because we have ancestors alive to change our inputs and therfore  condition our responses as well as other artifacts such as the technology  available today as opposed to before which change our inputs compared to those  of our ancestors and, thus change our behaviours BUT, how can WE (our  generation) learn everything our previous generations knew and then use that  knowledge to 'Create' ne knowledge and then continue the cycle?...surely this is  only possible if, every generation, we Pre-Prime the driver waveform of the  brain with some knowledge (that is, it is not a simple Sine wave but a complex  wavelett similar to that left over after a waveform has already 'Learned'  something)???         &nbsp;     Ahhh..well I would say you have  just touched the tip of a 10-years-worth-of-thought iceburg...maybe I should  finish this email here and continue my rant at another  time....       ;)       Hey, By the way, what time u  knocking of today?...chances of a lift?       Lastly, I am enjoying  discussing this with someone (for once) so much I have created an online blog  for it..you will get an invite email soon, we can continue this thread on there  (and, thus refer our notes or any links we get) from home.

       " \"                                Can you see yourself changing?   I went to the wedding of Luis and Maria Estrada today.  They are two of my very closest friends.  This was only the second wedding I'd ever been to for a friend.  It was a very interesting experience.  It was very different, very... emotional.  I don't think I've ever really experienced anything quite like it.  Throughout the duration of the ceremony and the traditions that followed, I found myself passing through every emotion found in life.  I saw new couples, broken hearts, and the love that comes from decades of two individuals striving to understanding one another.  I saw aspects of living that I'd completely forgotten, or neglected myself of.  I saw tragedy, and hope walking hand in hand.  I saw what I have never seen before.  Things are not always as they seem.  Too often we take for face value what someone does, or says, or when something happens.  It's really only in hind sight that we understand their true meaning, and most importantly what it means to us.  I saw that time and time again today.    Luis came to my house late at night a few days ago.  He was hand delivering invitations that he had forgotten to mail out.  I swear it was a stack of maybe a hundred or so invitations.  At face value, I laughed, 'what a silly thing to do' I thought.  Especially when contrasted with the Bride, the model of efficiency, who had mailed hers out months ago.  Until you're standing on stage next to the Bride and groom and you realize that there is no family on the bride's side of the aisle.  Suddenly... it was the right thing to do.  Suddenly the man is compassionate and caring, instead of comedically forgetful.  I know Luis, I know the cathedral would have been overwhelmed with friends and family, with all the people that  love  him.  But instead, it was just enough for you to know this man is special.  And just enough, so the Bride knows she finally has a  family .  That's not to say that Maria is not loved.  No, far from it.  There are very few that walk among us that could bond so quickly and strongly with so many.  But I am so thankful that God has blessed her with this man.  And likewise him with her.  We are so blind.  So blind.  We get so caught up in struggling with the day at hand that we never stop to look at our lives.  To  really  look at our lives.  And sometimes we take living for granted.  Imagine, all your life you have been lost, directionless, aimless, and unable to accept love unconditionally.  It's far more common than I fear to think about.  But imagine... finding that perfect love.  And that perfect love leads you to all those things.  Direction, purpose, pride, forgiveness, acceptance, and most importantly.. love.  Acceptance of love.  Belief... in love.  Then imagine finding all of those things,  and  children  and  family, then suddenly... the lover is gone.  Killed... senselessly... by a drunk driver.  Just as it feels your life together is just beginning.  I can't imagine it either.  It is beyond me.  It breaks my heart to try to think of it.  And Amy lives with that each day.  Why did it happen?  I don't know.  I'm not going to try to slap a 'catch-all' everything happens for a reason on it.  Because I've not lived through it.  All I  do  know, is that he wouldn't have changed a moment of it.  Because I know  I  wouldn't have changed a moment of it.  Not everyone is fortunate enough to be born into the circumstances that bestow upon us gifts like direction, understanding, and passion, and unconditional love.  And for those that God has blessed with those gifts, we find a great need to share it.  No matter what pain it brings us.  The circle of love cannot be broken.  Because when you are loved, you  want  to love.  You  want  others to know the great peace that comes with being loved without reason.  And death, nor doubt, nor pain can destroy that.  So if you have love... cherish it.  If you know love... share it.  If you want love... give it.  And don't ever take it for granted.   --Will                                \",\n",
       " \"                                Faith and Fear - Part One   I've been having mood swings all night.  This happens every so often.  And usually it's because of money... It's  always  because of money.  I ran across a site a couple days ago from some guys that I knew back in the day.  We met traveling the convention circuit and we always mingled in the same online circles.  Well they're hitting it big now with some of the new work they've been putting out.  I guess it's insecurity, or jealousy, or just the every day stress that needing money brings.  But it's sent me on some major emotional trips.    But that is the struggle that comes from trying to achieve your dreams.  It's the inner battle between  faith  and  comfort .  I don't have to struggle.  I could get a job and live comfortably.  I could go get a job tomorrow and have all my debt paid off in a year, and even have money left over to buy the car I've needed for so long.  And for all practical points and reasons that would be the best thing for me to do.  But faith tells me otherwise.  Faith tells me that I can do anything if I believe in myself and God enough.  Faith tells me that I can make more in one month working for myself than I could in a year working some meaningless job for someone else.  In theory, every day that I spend working to become successful and financially independent using only my talents, brings me that much closer to achieving that dream... in theory.  But that's been a long road traveled.  Seven long years traveled.  It's very trying.  And really, my faith has never let me down.  Anytime that I have actually put myself out there and trusted in my faith, it has been more successful than I ever imagined.  What  has  let me down, is me.  My fear, my inadequacies, my discipline, and even my own abilities.  But never faith.  I've worked hard to overcome those problems.  My abilities are not the problem any more, but they were for a very long time.  I've over come many of my fears and inadequacies.  But discipline... lack of discipline... still plagues me.  But that is what I've been working so hard these last few months to deal with.  I've been building discipline in all the simple things, so that eventually they will lead to discipline where it really matters.  As far as my financial struggles (which started this whole diatribe).  I was talking to a friend of mine the other day about a problem he was having financially.  It was getting to him.  And the advice that I gave him was to accept responsibility for what caused him to get to where he is, and make a plan for where he wants to be a year from now.  Don't dwell on the problem.  Find a solution, make a plan, and create the environment to achieve that plan.  It's much easier to deal with the problem if you can see it being fixed over a long period of time.    ...I guess that's the advice I need to give myself tonight.  I know how close I am to financial independence.  I know it's still a ways off, but very much attainable.  I just need to keep reminding myself to 'keep it simple' and continue making small, easy to achieve goals, so that I can see myself progressing.   --Will                       \",\n",
       " \"                                Fragments for March 6, 2004.    Here's another  urlLink Fragment  scene. The fragment meme is done by taking 3 random Fragment sentences and incorporating a story around them. The fragments are in bold.   The full moon light, blue and magical, casts shadows all around her as she sits awkwardly on the park bench.  Her throat is tight, and her heart is scared and she waits calm and cautiously for him to speak.  From time to time she steals looks from the ground up to his pale blue eyes.  The swish of trees circle around them like voices in a crowded room.  Her arms are wrapped tightly around her stomach as though trying to protect herself from harm.  He'd been acting strangely for days. He's been all shy glances, jittery hands and nervous laughter.  Not his normal ways.  And here now, sitting next to her, the strangeness grew exponentially.  His eyes struggle to meet hers.  His heart noticeably racing.  His mind entirely lost away.  Why was he so nervous?  What was it she had done?  What could take him so far from her?    She looks up to the sky to keep the tears from falling.  She watches the clouds swirl around the warm blue bowl of stars.  He gave her love, and  he did that without  want or thought of himself.   Did she let his love go unnoticed?  Did she not give enough?  Suddenly he clears his throat and she looks over to him.  Ready for it all to end.  She closes her eyes tightly, and unfolds her arms to ready for whatever lay before her.  A soft breeze blows her hair across her face and she notices the smell of roses on the air.  Suddenly she opens her eyes and finds his hand on her thigh... and he on one knee.    'I've... got a  question  for you.' he says softly, his voice cracking slightly with emotion.  Suddenly she sees a lifetime of love in his eyes.  She can't help but smile.  He smiles back.  Then there are words like 'Loving you is everything to me and it's all I want to do...'  And ' Why should I give   anything but  everything  to you?'  Then a ring, a promise and a dream and everything her heart had ever feared to hope for.  She simply  wanted to open the  moment and crawl inside forever.  Tears fall like wishes from a falling star and then... he takes her hand, and walks her back home.  Leaving the trees and the moon and the stars to remember his very important question.   'Some day somebody's gonna ask you... a question that you should say  yes  to...  once  in your life. Baby tonight... I've got a  question  for you.'   Question  - Old 97's   --Will                            \",\n",
       " \"                                Getting Comfortable   Comfortability is a big problem with me.  I've always been reluctant to do certain things because I wasn't comfortable with them.  And at the same time I was reluctant to change certain aspects of my life because I was  too  comfortable.  It takes a real commitment to be able to change those things.  And a conscious decision to choose my comfort zones.  Doing caricatures is one of those, because I never felt comfortable doing it.  It was always stressful because I wasn't skillful enough in the way I wanted to be and I was reluctant to do the work to change that.  Same thing with exercise and painting and dating and a dozen other things in my life.  So a lot of what I'm doing these days is forcing myself to do things that I don't like because I know they're good for me and that  eventually  I will grow to be comfortable doing them.  In the same way that I  know  that some of the stuff I'm comfortable with now, are  not  good for me.  I guess that's what maturity is really about.  Making conscious, healthy decisions even if you're not comfortable with them.  So anyways, on an unrelated note (or maybe it is related after all). I went down to the Lubbock Garden & Arts Center and signed up to teach summer classes.  Five of them actually.  It's been nearly three years since the last time I taught and geez have I grown since then.  I taught for nearly five years before that and I look back at it and think of all the kids I must have screwed up with what I  didn't  know, haha.  Oh well, I hope that I at least taught them to have fun doing it.  Anyways I ran into this guy named Chad that runs 'On Q' the alternative art gallery here in town.  He was signing up to teach some summer classes himself.  And I talked to him a little bit about renting out the art gallery for a show of my own stuff.  The funny thing is that I started painting again last night.  Really painting, with real paint even.  I haven't painted in years but it's been on my mind perpetually since January that I am going to learn to paint well and do an art show this year with all new artwork.  In fact they're numbers 6 and 7 on my goal list this year (1/28/04).  Come to think of it teaching art classes again was number 14 on that list.  It's funny how putting goals down in words suddenly makes them more real.  I swear to god that stuff is happening in my life to force me to finish those goals.  The universe is conspiring in every way to help me achieve them.  It's fascinating when you really think about it.

       " \"                                Hi Friends,      &nbsp;    I read the article 'Your Mindset Determines Your  Life' from the link  http://www.barvin.com/427.aspx .   Its very nice once... read it and njoy....   &nbsp;    Regards,     Prakash      &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Your Mindset Determines Your Life   by Sopan Greene   To keep at the top of your game you have to keep a clear head. You can't  afford to fill up on news and negativity. The world's overflowin' with it and  the only way to be a winner is to be in control of your thoughts.    Your thoughts become words, your words become actions and your actions become  your destiny. Someone else came up with that, but I've always remembered it  because it's true. Our actions show who we truly are and how shallow or deep our  character is.    Where you are today is a direct reflection of the words, thoughts and actions  you took days, months and years ago. No matter how much some people blame their  parents,teachers, where they grew up, television, the government or anything  else, the truth is that nobody got them where they are today but themselves. The  longer we choose to not take responsibility for our lives, the longer we'll  living uninspired lives that we don't love.    I've heard 40 year old adults who complain about their lives and take no  responsiblility for what they've created. Give me a break. If you think you're  on the recieving end of life you're mistaken and too lazy to do anything about  it.    Simply think about the pictures you've seen on TV of people in third world  countries. When I start to get mad about having to stand behind two people in a  line at the grocery store I remind myself that a lot of people don't even know  where their food will come from tonight. This shifts me from anger to gratitude.     The next time you notice yourself getting frustrated or angry about something  in your life I invite you to shift your focus onto what's great in your life. It  doesn't matter if you think you don't have enough money or you're mad at your  dog for chewing up a shoe. Remember how much love you get from having your dog  in the first place and how your weekly earnings are more than some people make  in a month or year.    Keep your focus on what is working - for you and for others. We are bombarded  with negative input all day long. We need to watch what goes in because our  livlihoods depend on what we creatively crank out. Our heads need to be full of  positive inspiration or free space where we can dream.    A recent study revealed that the people who watch the most television news  are the most fearful in our society. Crime has been going down in America for  over a decade, but since the news focuses on it and repeats it over and over, a  lot of people are receiving multiple messages that the world isn't safe. These  people end up being less confident and less successful as a result of being  emotinally paralyzed to a degree by their fears.    Remember the old phrase 'garbage in, garbage out'? If you were asked to be on  television based on the person you are today would it be on Jerry Springer or  Oprah?    Yeah, I know. You're probably laughing or snickering right now. I can  practically see that questioning look of disbelief on your face.    You may even think that you wouldn't be on either one. Just imagine that  there's a guy at your door and he's going to put you in a limo right now and you  have to pick one show or the other to be a guest on or you'll be locked in your  house for a month. (It's silly, but you get the point, I want you to get into  it).    There's a definite difference between Oprah guests and Jerry's guests.  Oprah's guests radiate confidence and have taken responsibility for their lives  and have created lemonade out of lemons. Jerry's guests radiate low self esteem  and think they're victims of life. Even worse, they think they have a right to  inflict their negative self-defeating attitude on others.    Oprah people know that they're on the creative end of life. Jerry people  choose to think they're on the receiving end of life. And the truth is that if  that's what they beleive then thats what they get. It's an easy cop out to  settle in life and a lot of folks do it.    It's important to keep a positive mental attitude nomatter what your life is  like because nothing is more important than your thoughts. They determine how  you'll experience the next minute, hour, day, week, year, decade and century.  Rid your life of people and circumstances that don't inspire and enliven you.  Life's simply too short to put up distracting drama and complainers who never  change anything.    We all throw around phrases about how life is too short, but we don't live  that way. Take at least one action today to reaffirm that you're creating a life  you love.    Fire a friend who drains your energy. Read from an autobiography of a person  who inspires you. Turn off the TV and write your goals and values. Take a walk  in nature or with a friend who supports the best in you. Write a note to someone  who has impacted your life in a positive way to let them know you're grateful  for having them in your life. Rub your dog's belly and watch a doggy smile of  ecstasy come out to greet you.    You're building a powerful future. Study successful people and you'll notice  they all surround themselves with other inspired and successful people. Your  life is your show, choose to be an Oprah person and aviod the Jerry people who  show up in your life. Or better yet, treat the Jerry people you meet like they  are the Oprah person buried inside them so we can all shine together.    Let your positive mental attitude infect everyone you meet and we'll all  enjoy better lives.    &nbsp;     &nbsp;          \",\n",

       " \"                                I completed my primary education in the year 1994 from Vidya Sagar which now changed it's name to MGM School. The medium was English and English medium schools were very rare at my place that time. it was located in the nearest town to my Village. The town named Mananthavady was the cultural and business centre of Wayanad District.                  Then I  completed my high school studies in the year 1997 from St. Catherines HSS Payyampally which is located very near to my home. During that time my father was the principal of the school and my mother was teaching there. So I had great responsibilities. It turned out that what ever I did in the school became a talk. So I the situation forced me to be an ideal student always. Otherwise my activities would throw mud on the images of my parents.                   Later I joined St. Joseph's College, Devagiri for my Pre Degree Course which was locaed it the neighbouring district to my home. I was a student in the science batch(Mathematics - First group) I stayed in hostel there and completed PDC in the year 1999. Now the Pre Degree System no more exists. I was lucky to be a student of last batch of PDC in the state. Because government changed the system to Higer Secondary Education from 1999.                                In 1999 I attended the state engineering entrance exam and got through it. I have an option to take the engineering seets available in the state. I opted for Computer Science and Engineering in Govt Engineering College, Wayanad. The college is situated in Mananthavady and I joined the college. My batch was the first batch of my college. I opted for the particular seat because the institution was very near to my home. I finished my B.Tech programme in the year 2003. The college was affiliated to the University of Kannur.      \",\n",
       " \"                                I got this material from xml.com    &nbsp;       What is  RDF?     By  Tim  Bray                 Spanish Translation available  here .     This article was first published as ' RDF and Metadata ' on XML.com  in June 1998. It has been updated by  ILRT's  Dan Brickley, chair of the W3C's  RDF Interest Group, to reflect the growing use of RDF and updates to the  specification since 1998.     The Right Way to Find Things    RDF stands for Resource Description Framework. RDF is built for the Web, but  let's leave the Web behind for now and think about how we find things in the  real world.   Scenario 1: The Library   You're in a library to find books on raising donkeys as pets. In most  libraries these days you'd use the computer lookup system, basically an  electronic version of the old card file. This system allows you to list books by  author, title, subject, and so on. The list includes the date, author, title,  and lots of other useful information, including (most important of all) where  each book is.   Scenario 2: The Video Store   You're in a video store and you want a movie by John Huston. A large modern  video store offers a lookup facility that's similar to the library's. Of course,  the search properties are different (director, actors, and so on) but the  results are more or less the same.   Scenario 3: The Phone Book   You're working late at a customer's office in South Denver, and it seems that  a pizza is essential if work is to continue. Fortunately, every office comes  equipped with a set of Yellow Pages that, when properly used, can lead to quick  pizza delivery.   The Common Thread   What do all these situations have in common, and what differences lie behind  the scenes? First of all, each of these systems is based on  metadata ,  that is, information about information. In each case, you need a piece of  information (the book's location, the video's name, the pizza joint's phone  number) you don't have. In each case, you use metadata (information about  information) to get it.   We're all used to this stuff; metadata ordinarily comes in named chunks  (subject, director, business category) that associate lookup information  ('donkeys', 'John Huston', 'Pizza, South Side') with the information you're  really after.   Here's a subtle but important point -- in theory, metadata is not really  necessary: you could go through the library one book at a time looking for  donkey books, or through the video store shelves until you found your movie, or  call all the numbers in your area code until you find pizza delivery. But that  would be very wasteful, in fact, it would be stupid. Metadata is the way to  go.    It's All Different Behind the Scenes    In each of our scenarios, we used metadata, and we used it in remarkably  similar ways. Does this mean that the library, the video store, and the phone  company all use the same metadata setup? Of course not. Every library has a  choice among at least two systems for organizing their books, and among many  vendors who will sell them software to do the looking-up. The same is obviously  true for video stores and phone companies.   In fact most such products define their own system of metadata and their own  facilities for storing and managing it. They typically do  not  offer  facilities for sharing or interchanging it. This doesn't cause too much of a  problem, assuming they do a decent job with the user interface. We are  comfortable enough with the general process we call 'looking things up' (really,  searching via metadata) that we are able to adapt and use all these different  systems.    Not Just For Searching    The most common daily use of metadata is to aid our discovery of things. But  there are lots of other uses going on behind the scenes. The library and video  store are storing other metadata that you don't see: how often the books and  videos are being used, how much it cost to buy them, where to go for a  replacement, etc. Running a library or a video store would be unthinkable  without metadata. Similarly, the phone company, of course, uses its metadata,  most obviously to  print  the Yellow Pages, but for many other internal  management and administration tasks.    What About the Web?    The Web is a lot like a really  really  big library. There are  millions of things out there, and if you know the URL (in effect a kind of call  number) you can get them. Since the Web has books, movies, and pizza joints, the  number of ways you might want to look things up includes all the things a  library uses, plus all the things the video store uses, plus all the things the  Yellow Pages use, and lots more.   The problem at the moment is that there is hardly any metadata on the Web. So  how do we find things? Mostly by using dumb, brute force techniques. The dumb,  brute force is supplied by the wandering web robots of search engine sites like  Altavista, Infoseek, and Excite. These sites do the equivalent of going through  the library, reading every book, and allowing us to look things up based on the  words in the text. It's not surprising that people complain about search  results, or that the robots are always way behind the growth and change of the  Web.   In fact there is one metadata-based general purpose lookup facility: Yahoo!  Yahoo doesn't use a robot. When you search through Yahoo, you're searching  through human-generated subject categories and site labels. Compared to the  amount of metadata that a library maintains for its books, Yahoo! is pitiful;  but its popularity is clear evidence of the power of (even limited)  metadata.                                           '>         by Tim Bray      Divine Metadata for the Web    People who have thought about these problems, including many librarians and  webmasters, generally agree that the Web urgently needs metadata. What would it  look like? If the Web had an all-powerful Grand Organizing Directorate (at  www.GOD.org), it would think up a set of lookup fields such as Author, Title,  Date, Subject, and so on. The Directorate, being, after all, GOD, would simply  decree that all Web pages start using this divine Metadata, and that would be  that. Of course there would be some details such as how the Web sites ought to  package up and interchange the metadata, and we all know that the Devil is in  the details, but GOD can lick the Devil any day.   In fact, there is no  www.GOD.org . For this  reason, there is no chance that everyone will agree to start using the same  metadata facilities. If libraries, which have existed for hundreds of years,  can't agree on a single standard, there's not much chance that the Web will.   Does this mean that there is no chance for metadata? That everyone is going  to have to build their own lookup keys and values and software, and that we're  going to be stuck using dumb, brute force robots forever?   No. As we observed with our three search scenarios, metadata operations have  an awful lot in common, even when the metadata is different. RDF is an effort to  identify these common threads and provide a way for Web architects to use them  to provide useful Web metadata without divine intervention.    Introducing RDF    Resource Description Framework, as its name implies, is a framework for  describing and interchanging metadata. It is built on the following rules.       A  Resource  is anything that can have a URI; this includes all the    Web's pages, as well as individual elements of an XML document. An example of    a resource is a draft of the document you are now reading and its URL is     http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why.html      A  Property  is a Resource that has a name and can be used as a    property, for example  Author  or  Title . In many    cases, all we really care about is the name; but a Property needs to be a    resource so that it can have its own properties.     A  Statement  consists of the combination of a Resource, a Property,    and a value. These parts are known as the 'subject', 'predicate' and 'object'    of a Statement. An example Statement is 'The Author of     http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why.html  is Tim Bray.' The value can    just be a string, for example 'Tim Bray' in the previous example, or it can be    another resource, for example 'The Home-Page of     http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why.html  is     http://www.textuality.com .'     There is a straightforward method for expressing these abstract Properties    in XML, for example:     &lt;rdf:Description about='http://www.textuality.com/RDF/Why-RDF.html'&gt; &lt;Author&gt;Tim Bray&lt;/Author&gt;  &lt;Home-Page rdf:resource='http://www.textuality.com' /&gt; &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;     RDF is carefully designed to have the following characteristics.        Independence      Since a Property is a resource, any independent organization (or even    person) can invent them. I can invent one called Author, and you can invent    one called Director (which would only apply to resources that are associated    with movies), and someone else can invent one called Restaurant-Category. This    is necessary since we don't have a GOD to take care of it for us.      Interchange      Since RDF Statements can be converted into XML, they are easy for us to    interchange. This would probably be necessary even if we  did  have a    GOD.      Scalability      RDF statements are simple, three-part records (Resource, Property, value),    so they are easy to handle and look things up by, even in large numbers. The    Web is already big and getting bigger, and we are probably going to have    (literally) billions of these floating around (millions even for a big    Intranet). Scalability is important.      Properties are Resources      Properties can have their own properties and can be found and manipulated    like any other Resource. This is important because there are going to be lots    of them; too many to look at one by one. For example, I might want to know if    anyone out there has defined a Property that describes the genre of a movie,    with values like Comedy, Horror, Romance, and Thriller. I'll need metadata to    help with that.      Values Can Be Resources      For example, most web pages will have a property named Home-Page which    points at the home page of their site. So the values of properties, which    obviously have to include things like title and author's name, also have to    include Resources.      Statements Can Be Resources      Statements can also have properties. Since there's no GOD to provide    useful assertions for all the resources, and since the Web is way too big for    us to provide our own, we're going to need to do lookups based on other    people's metadata (as we do today with Yahoo!). This means that we'll want,    given any Statement such as 'The Subject of this Page is Donkeys', to be able    to ask 'Who said so? And When?' One useful way to do this would be with    metadata; so Statements will need to have Properties.      Why Not Just Use XML?    XML allows you to invent tags, which may contain both text data and other  tags. XML has a built-in distinction between  element types , for example  the  IMG  element type in HTML, and  elements , for example an  individual  &lt;img src='Madonna.jpg'&gt; ; this corresponds  naturally to the distinction between Properties and Statements. So it seems as  though XML documents should be a natural vehicle for exchanging general purpose  metadata.   XML, however, falls apart on the  Scalability  design goal. There are  two problems:       The order in which elements appear in an XML document is significant and    often very meaningful. This seems highly unnatural in the metadata world. Who    cares whether a movie's Director or Title is listed first, as long as both are    available for lookups? Furthermore, maintaining the correct order of millions    of data items is expensive and difficult, in practice.     XML allows constructions like    &lt;Description&gt;The value of this property contains some text, mixed up with child properties such as its temperature (&lt;Temp&gt;48&lt;/Temp&gt;) and longitude  (&lt;Longt&gt;101&lt;/Longt&gt;). [&amp;Disclaimer;]&lt;/Description&gt;   When you represent general XML documents in  computer memory, you get weird data structures that mix trees, graphs, and  character strings. In general, these are hard to handle in even moderate  amounts, let alone by the billion.   On the other hand, something like XML is an absolutely necessary part of the  solution to RDF's  Interchange  design goal. XML is unequalled as an  exchange format on the Web. But by itself, it doesn't provide what you need in a  metadata framework.                                           '>         by Tim Bray      The Devil is in the Details    The four general rules given above define the central ideas of RDF. It turns  out that it takes quite a lot of abstract terminology and XML syntax to define  them precisely enough that people can write computer programs to process them.  In particular, turning Statements into Resources is quite tricky. It also turns  out that in a (very) few cases, you do need to order your properties, and this  requires quite a bit of syntax.   This article doesn't explain all these details; there are a variety of  excellent resources to be found at  http://www.w3.org/RDF  that are designed to do  just that.    Vocabularies    RDF, as we've seen, provides a model for metadata, and a syntax so that  independent parties can exchange it and use it. What it  doesn't  provide  though is any Properties of its own. RDF doesn't define Author or Title or  Director or Business-Category. That would be a job for GOD, if there were one.  Since there isn't, it's a job for everyone.   It seems unlikely that one Property standing by itself is apt to be very  useful. It is expected that these will come in packages; for example, a set of  basic bibliographic Properties like Author, Title, Date, and so on. Then a more  elaborate set from OCLC and a competing one from the Library of Congress. These  packages are called  Vocabularies ; it's easy to imagine Property  vocabularies describing books, videos, pizza joints, fine wines, mutual funds,  and many other species of Web wildlife.    What RDF Might Mean    The Web is too big for anyone person to stay on top of. In fact, it contains  information about a huge number of subjects, and for most of those subjects  (such as fine wines, home improvement, and cancer therapy), the Web has too much  information for any one person to stay on top of and much of anything else .   This means that opinions, pointers, indexes, and anything that helps people  discover things are going to be commodities of very high value. Nobody thinks  that everyone will use the same vocabulary (nor should they), but with RDF we  can have a marketplace in vocabularies. Anyone can invent them, advertise them,  and sell them. The good (or best-marketed) ones will survive and prosper.  Probably most niches of information will come to be dominated by a small number  of vocabularies, the way that library catalogs are today.   And even among people who are sharing the use of metadata vocabularies,  there's no need to share the same software. RDF makes it possible to use  multiple pieces of software to process the same metadata, and to use a single  piece of software to process (at least in part) many different metadata  vocabularies.   With any luck, this should make the Web more like a library, or a video  store, or a phone book, than it is today.      Getting started with RDF    Since RDF became a W3C Recommendation in February 1999, a number of tools  have been created by developers working with RDF. For an in-depth treatment of  these, consult the  W3C RDF home page . A  number of other listings are available, including  XML.com ,  XMLhack  and Dave Beckett's  RDF Resource Guide .    Developer Community    The main email list for RDF developer discussion is W3C's  RDF Interest Group . A number of other  RDF-related discussion lists exist, including the  Mozilla-RDF  forum (the Mozilla and  Netscape 6 browsers make heavy use of RDF). More recently, the  RDF-Logic  list has  been  announced ,  providing a forum for the discussion of formal, logic-based approaches to  knowledge representation for the Web. DARPA's  DAML  (DARPA Agent Markup Language) initiative  uses the RDF-Logic list for discussions and announcements.   The RDF developer community is rather diverse, which is reflected in the  nature of online discussions on the RDF lists. While one strand of RDF  development is concerned with highly formal topics (RDF-Logic, DAML and so on),  others are busy deploying simpler, more pragmatic applications for Web-based  content and metadata syndication. All these themes meet (sometimes productively,  sometimes confusingly) on the RDF Interest Group list, but they also typically  each have a dedicated email list. For example, the  RSS-DEV  group has produced the   RDF Site Summary (RSS) 1.0  Specification,  which provides an RDF-based channel format, designed for interoperability with  high level vocabularies such as  Dublin Core  as  well as a variety of more application-specific RDF vocabularies.   Notes on Update (Dan Brickley)   This update to the 1998 article serves only to synchronize it with recent RDF  terminology. Since this document was first published, the  W3C  has published the  Model and Syntax  specification as  a Recommendation.   I have updated the markup example to use current RDF 1.0 syntax. There have  also been some terminology changes: 'PropertyType' became 'Property', 'Property'  became 'Statement'. I have also added a brief mention of  subject/predicate/object terminology, and lowercased a few mentions 'Value'  (since rdf:object replaced rdf:value for talking about the object of a  statement).          \",\n",

I looked up and saw that it was a stewardess passing by with a flight crew. I was busy at the ticket counter, so I just smiled back.  I was on my way to London, where I would catch a connecting flight to an Islamic country. An hour later as I entered the plane, I saw the same stewardess, and she greeted me again with a cheerful 'Hari Bol!'  'Hari Bol!' I answered. I looked at her badge and saw that she was the chief purser.  After we were airborne she came by and sat on the armrest of the seat directly across the aisle from me. A few passengers raised their eyebrows, but she was not disturbed. 'I can afford it,' she said. 'I've been with the company for twenty years. I'm retiring next month.'  'Congratulations,' I said.  Her face became more serious. 'You know,' she said,  'I was married to a Hare Krsna devotee when I was young.'  My own eyebrows went up. 'Oh really?' I said.  'Yes,' she answered, 'but he'd left the movement by the time we met. He was a disciple of the founder, Swami Prabhupada. He referred to his departure as blooping.'  'Yes,' I said, 'that's the sound an object makes when it falls into the ocean. When a devotee leaves the movement and falls back into the ocean of material existence, we call it blooping.'  'Well he certainly struggled with his decision to leave,' she said. 'He didn't actually tell me that he had been a devotee until late into our marriage. For years I saw him wrestle with conflicting interests. On the one hand he had a deep interest in spiritual things, but on the other he had an uncontrollable urge to enjoy the material.  'One night we got drunk, and on an impulse he took me to your center outside of London, the place George Harrison bought you. I don't remember much, but when he started to cry in front of the altar, we were asked to leave. It's the only time I ever visited one of your temples.  'As time went on, my husband succumbed to his material passions and started to take drugs. In a desperate move to help him, I got the principal book of your faith, the Bhagavad-gita As It Is from a friend. My husband had spoken of it many times. I must have read that book ten times cover to cover, hoping to learn what had once satisfied the soul of my husband.  'As I learned the Gita I began sharing my understanding with him, wanting to revive his faith. I even memorized certain verses and would repeat them when he was really down and out. As his drug addiction deepened and he began stealing to maintain it, I often searched feverishly through the Gita, looking for passages or words of advice that would turn him away from his decadence.  'But it was of no avail. After some time the combination of drugs, internal conflicts, and pressures of life caused him to go mad, totally mad. I had to commit him to a mental hospital. He has never recovered and is still there to this day.'  She had been speaking with emotion, and several other passengers were listening in. They looked as amazed as I must have.  'It was a painful loss for me,' she continued, 'and I never remarried.'  Then she put her hand on my shoulder. 'But do you know how I survived that and many other trials in my life?' she asked.  'How?' I asked, almost on behalf of the other passengers listening in.  'The philosophy of the Bhagavad-gita,' she said with a relieved smile. 'I still read the Gita every day. It's in my carry-on luggage up front. If it weren't for that book, I'd probably be in the same madhouse as my former husband.'  'I'll be retiring soon and plan to buy a little house in Wales,' she continued. 'And you know how I'll spend much of my time?'  'No, Ma'am,' I said. 'How?'  'Reading the Bhagavad-gita,' she replied.  Suddenly the flight ran into turbulence and the 'fasten seatbelt' light came on. The stewardess nodded a little to confirm her last statement, and got up to go. As she was leaving, I called out to her. 'Ma'am,' I said, 'can I have the address of the mental hospital? I'd like to try and help your former husband.'  She shook her head. 'No,' she said, 'I can't do that.'  'Please,' I said. 'It's important to me. He's my spiritual brother.'  'I'm sorry' she replied, and she turned to walk down the aisle. 'I wouldn't want to open that chapter of my life again.'  When the plane landed and the passengers began to disembark she was standing at the door, smiling politely as we filed out. I stopped and gently tried to encourage her to tell me where her previous husband was, but she wouldn't give in.  'Move on!' a man shouted behind me.  I thanked the stewardess for sharing her story with me, but I walked out of the plane with mixed emotions. I was elated to have met someone who had found such shelter in the teachings of Bhagavad-gita, but distraught to hear how another, a Godbrother, in fact, had failed miserably to do the same.  In a men's room in Heathrow Airport, I changed from my devotional clothes into something more Western and waited to board my connecting flight. I felt a bit uncomfortable, as I had to remove my neck beads and Brahmin thread and replace it all with a New York Yankees baseball cap.  I was on my way to one of the more conservative Islamic states, and in order to understand the country more, I had bought a book on Shariah, the Islamic law that governs strict Muslim societies. As the flight took off and I started reading, some of the laws raised my eyebrows again, more than once.  Shariah states that a murderer must be killed in the same way that he murdered but can be set free if the bereaved family agrees to take some money instead of having the murderer killed.  A thief must have his hand cut off, and if he steals again, he will lose the other hand plus a foot.  A man may keep four wives but cannot keep two sisters as wives.  Women must be fully covered at all times except in the privacy of their homes.  I began to realize the strictness of the country I was entering, and as we were landing, I pushed my Nrsimha salagram deeper into my bag, hoping that if I was searched, the customs officials wouldn't find Him.  It didn't work. After clearing immigration, I approached customs control and was stopped by two women in burkas, the full black dress worn by Muslim women with even the eyes covered by a black veil. The women asked me to step to one side. Then two men in starched white robes came over and asked me to put all my belongings onto a table. As I laid my saffron cloth out they looked surprised, but when I put my Srimad Bhagavatam on the table their eyes opened even wider.  'What is this?' the man asked in broken English.  'A storybook,' I replied.  'What is in the shoulder bag?' he asked.  'Not much' I replied, pretending I didn't know he wanted to see it.  'Put it on the table,' he said.  I had no choice, and after a few moments they were inspecting my japa beads, and to my horror, my Nrsimha salagram.  'My Lord,' I prayed silently, 'please forgive me.'  One of the customs officials started to smell the salagram. 'What is it?' he asked.  I was so distraught I couldn't reply.  'What is it?' he repeated impatiently.  'What does it look like?' I said, not wanting to further my grief by having to refer to the salagram in some mundane way, and in front of the Lord Himself.  'It looks like a stone,' he said.  'So?' I replied.  And he put Him back in the bag.  They seemed eager to inspect the rest of my belongings, but suddenly another official came up. 'Are you a soldier?' he asked me.  I saw my way out of the predicament. 'Yes, sir' I replied with confidence thinking back on my days as a marine. 'Lance Corporal Tibbitts. First Infrantry Battalion, United States Marine Corps. My company is on duty in this region.'  'Fine,' he replied. Then he turned to the other men. 'Let him go,' he said.  As I walked out of the airport, loudspeakers from nearby mosques reminded the faithful that it was time to bow toward Mecca, and a number of men spread their rugs on the ground to pray. I even saw several cars stop and men get out on the sidewalk to bow.  My contact picked me up, and we drove to the place where I would be staying. As in other strict Islamic states, I noticed the streets were clean and everything seemed orderly. Bars, discotheques, and nightclubs were conspicuous by their absence, and men and women did not mix freely. It was easy to distinguish the two: the men wore bright starched white robes, and a number of women wore dark black burkas, covering them from head to toe.  'Put your baseball cap back on,' my host said as we pulled up to his house.  'It's only a few meters to the front door,' I said, a little surprised.  'It only takes one complaint here,' he said soberly.  Programs were held in the evening in different houses, quietly, behind closed doors that blocked any noise. I was told that programs were not forbidden but any excess would not be tolerated.  During my visit, I favored lecturing more than kirtan. I had plenty to say because I had plenty of time to study. Confined to my room and not able to wander outside freely, I managed to read Teachings of Lord Caitanya from cover to cover in 7 days.  I wasn't used to being inside all day, though, and at one point I became restless, almost desperate. 'I'd like to go home,' I said out loud to myself one morning.  But then I looked in the mirror and scolded myself. 'Home?' I asked. 'A home? You're in the renounced order. You should be ashamed of yourself!' Then I imposed a small punishment on myself for my momentary lack of sannyasa dharma. 'Tomorrow,' I vowed, 'I will fast all day.'  The day after my fast,  my host came and said that we were going to drive out of town for a program with workers from India. 'Laborers from abroad?' I thought. 'Sounds like it will be a real simple program.'  As we drove through the countryside, I noticed many date trees lining the road. My host turned to me. 'Shariah states that you can receive a huge fine for indiscriminately cutting down a date tree,' he said.  'Really?' I replied.  'Yes,' he said, 'and God forbid if you hit a camel with your car. They are a protected species here. And if you do hit a camel, you'll get instant karma. They are so top-heavy, with their long spindly legs and heavy bodies, that they immediately come through the windshield. Many people have died in that way.'  'That's interesting,' I said.  My host turned to me with a puzzled look. 'Interesting?' he said.  'Not interesting in the sense of entertaining,' I said, 'but in a curious way.'  His misunderstanding of my comment only added to the frustration I was feeling from living in isolation, and I was feeling the rigors of my self-imposed fast the day before. 'I'd sure like to be in Vrindavan right now,' I said to myself.  We pulled up to an old warehouse. 'I'll make this real quick,' I thought.  I pulled my Yankee baseball cap squarely over my forehead, adjusted my belt, jumped out of the car, and walked quickly towards the entrance before any of the locals would notice me, as was the usual procedure.  As I entered the reception office, I was surprised to hear a wonderful Bengali kirtan tape over the sound system. 'Sounds from the spiritual sky,' I said to myself. 'It's almost like being in Mayapura.' I closed my eyes and paused for a moment to take in the auspicious sound.  My host took my arm. 'Let's move into the main room,' he said. Reluctantly, I tore myself away from my brief moment in the spiritual world.  But what a wonderful surprise was waiting for me! As I opened the door, I was stunned to see a group of 40 Bengali men, many in dhoti and kurta, playing mrdangas and kartalas while chanting the holy names and dancing in ecstasy. It wasn't a tape I had heard after all. It was a live kirtan.  A devotee was singing and the others responded:  'Gaurangera duti pada, jar dhana sampada, se jane bhakati-rasa-sar'  It was Savarana-Sri-Gaura-Mahima (The Glories of Sri Gauranga), a song from Narottam das Thakur's Prarthana: 'Anyone who has accepted the two lotus feet of Lord Caitanya can understand the true essence of devotional service.'  'Gaurangera madhura-lila' The lead singer sang loudly, 'Jar karne prabesila, hrdoya mirmala bhelo tar'  And again came a chorus of voices in their mother tongue:  'Anyone who has accepted the two lotus feet of Lord Caitanya can understand the true essence of devotional service.'  With their arms upwards and their eyes to the sky they sang:  'Je gaurangera nama loy tara hoy premodoy, tare mui jai bolihari'  'One who simply takes the holy name of Gaurasundara, Sri Krsna Caitanya, will immediately develop love of God. To such a person I say, 'Bravo! Very nice! Excellent!''  The men were dancing gracefully, and their faces and movements were full of feeling. They were so absorbed in kirtan rasa that they didn't notice I'd come in.  Suddenly they saw me, and they all dove in front of me, offering obeisances. I stood there embarrassed, feeling unworthy of the attention of men who displayed such feeling for Lord Caitanya.  One of them handed me a drum and I started to sing slowly,  'sri-krsna-caitanya prabhu doya koro mor, toma bine ke doyalu jagat-somsare'  'My dear Lord Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu, please be merciful to me, because who can be more merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds?'  Oblivious to where we were, we dove again and again into the nectar of chanting the holy names for over an hour. Though we were strangers, the joy of the kirtan made us one spiritual family, and we chanted and danced with abandon, as if we had known each other for years.  After bringing the kirtan to a close, I asked them to suggest a subject for my talk. A small chorus of men spoke up. 'Speak about Gauranga Mahaprabhu,' they said almost in unison.  So I told about the pastime of Lord Caitanya's taking sannyasa. When I got to the part about the barber cutting Mahaprabhu's beautiful long black hair, several of the men had tears in their eyes.  After an hour, I concluded, and because it was getting late I stood up, but they immediately put a mrdanga in my hands. 'More kirtan!' they said. 'More kirtan!'  'Who has come to enliven whom?' I thought. 'These men are very merciful to me.'  Again we had kirtan and then relished a traditional Bengali feast, complete with Lord Caitanya's favorite preparation, a leafy vegetable called sak. At the end, I was inundated with Bengali sweets.  In the three hours I spent with those men I learned an important lesson. In their association I became oblivious to the discomforts of being in a foreign land and felt perfectly at home, in a spiritual atmosphere. I realized that although my preferred places of residence, the holy lands of Vrindavan and Mayapura, were far away in India, they are in fact manifested wherever devotees are chanting the Lord's holy names. It was a valuable lesson and one I pray I will not forget.  'When Krishna descended on the earth, He appeared in Vrindavan. Although I am presently living in America, my residence is in Vrindavan, because I am always thinking of Krishna. Although I may be in a New York apartment, my consciousness is there, and this is as good as living there.'

       " \"                                Working around myself   It's been a very emotionally challenging couple of days.  I started off so well yesterday, but ended on a very low down note.  As the girl at the art-supply store said to me today  'I had a sudden rush of extreme exhaustion.'   I think the down-turn started when I got a message from Disney saying that they're passing on the Pirate story.  Which although, I expected, and tried to prepare myself for, still affected me in a big way.  They still want to see the rest of my proposals, having really liked what I sent and liked my previous works.  So I'm bitching about it, but there's no way I won't follow through on doing it.  It's way too good of an opportunity.  It may take me a little while to regroup and re-double my efforts, but I always do.  My concern is that working in this manner with them is the complete opposite of everything I've been figuring out for myself.  Everything I've learned in recent months has told me to start and finish something.  Follow through completely.  But what I'm supposed to do with Disney, is start lots of little things, in the hopes that one of them will be worth following through on.  It's  anti -productive.  It's too easy to fail, because there are no little  victories  keeping me going.  But like I said, too good to pass up.  At least now I know exactly what they're looking for (like the  true  target audience and genre).  I didn't have that to work with before.  So, I have two more stories nearly completed and ready to send, I'll finish those and send them out.  If it doesn't work out, well... it is what it is.  Unfortunately that wasn't all that brought me down today.  Although it was a big flakey chunk of it.  Really it was a combination of things, not wanting to do caricatures today, not enough money to start with today, too many happy couples, too many cute girls, and the MALL and having to go fit myself for a wedding tux today.  It's like I have a really high-tolerance for pain and emotional stress, but once I get to that break-point, it's nothing but free-fall from there out.  Luckily there's Chinese food, and cute girls, and making lots more money than I expected today, and finally getting a modicum of control over the airbrush and... tomorrow.  I really do see things getting better.   I bought more artboard so I can practice painting again this week.  I see HUGE potential for income with doing caricatures.  And I noticed I didn't look so bad in those evil mall mirrors.  At least better than I did last year.  So I'm moving forward, using all my breath.  You see my ship still stands no matter what you drop and there aint a whole lot that you can do.  Sure the banner may be town and perhaps I've grown a little cynical.  But I know, no matter what the waitress brings I shall drink it and always be full.  So all I can do is pour some tea for two, and speak my point of view.  It will all come back to me, gonna get what I deserve.  Lovin' that's what I got.... hmmm.  Time for a nap.   --Will       \",\n",

'                                  --Psalm 24:8   A word from the Word: Read Mark 2:1-12  '...Who but God can forgive sins!' Mark 2:7 (NLT)   Food for Thought: Who but God...    Who but God? The question was asked by the Religious elite. Those with PhDs and MDivs. 'Who but God can forgive sins?' They were right in their theology, but they weren't about to admit that a carpernter from Nazareth was God incarnate.See, they had God figured out. They knew how He would operate, and to whom He would operate for. Salvation was an honor to be received for those who worked really hard to be religiously righteous. Now this day their time tested truth was challenged. Standing before them was the One whose word they taught. As was the case when Jesus went to a town to teach, the place became packed. Let's look at what Mark has to say about this scene.    '2 Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there wasn't room for one more person, not even outside the door. And he preached the word to them. 3 Four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. 4 They couldn't get to Jesus through the crowd, so they dug through the clay roof above his head. Then they lowered the sick man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus. 5 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 'My son, your sins are forgiven.'  6 But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there said to themselves, 7 'What? This is blasphemy! Who but God can forgive sins! 8Jesus knew what they were discussing among themselves, so he said to them, 'Why do you think this is blasphemy? 9 Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man, `Your sins are forgiven' or `Get up, pick up your mat, and walk'? 10 I will prove that I, the Son of Man, have the authority on earth to forgive sins.' Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, 11'Stand up, take your mat, and go on home, because you are healed!'  12The man jumped up, took the mat, and pushed his way through the stunned onlookers. Then they all praised God. 'We've never seen anything like this before!' they exclaimed.'    Despite the grumbles of the Religious leaders, man who had been lame was made well. He was lowered on a mat into the middle of the room. A mat where he spent most of his life lying and watching children run, lovers dance, and countless others walk. This day would be different, this day he was going to see Jesus. Surely news had to have spread to this man's home. Maybe he thought it was a long shot, but he found a way to meet the one others were calling the Christ. One touch from the hand of God. One word spoken from the mouth of God. And stiff, rigid legs began to have feeling. First a tingle down the left leg, and then suddenly a burst of sensation as nerves were made new, and muscles made strong. He came to Christ as a cripple, but he left via the front door, mobile and made new.    Don't we come to Christ that way? Maybe we're not crippled physically, but the pain of the past, coupled with the burden of guilt we've been living with has crippled us in a spiritual sense.Unable to enjoy life. Unable to walk with confidence thatr our lives are directed by the Master's plan. What is crippling you? Is it fear? Whatever it is, we cling to our mats. We cling to the familiar. It may not be  the best place to be, but it's all we know. We've been there so long, we don't know how to walk anymore. Deep within, there is a desire to get beyond our mats, but we're afraid of what's out there, so we stay there.     The onlookers in the story praised God for the healing of the lame man. Theydidn't seem to have a faith problem linking the power of God with Jesus. The religious leaders asked 'who but God can forgive sins?' With actions that said, 'Your right. No one but God can. That's why I am here. Because I can!' The onlookers had witnessed a wonderful act of love. They learned a lesson that we need to learn everyday, when Christ is near, expect the unexpected.    Though the question was asked, 'Who but God can...?' It's a good question to cnsider when we find ourselves stuck on our mats. God can, even when, no especially when we can't. Together, with God's touch, we can. See, when God shows up on the scene there is no room for crippling fear or paralyzing doubt. Amen.          \",\n",

Any more of this craziness would have been invalid.         &nbsp;        So here I am sitting in front of the Ohio Book of Building codes trying to figure out the &#8216;Occupant Load Actual&#8217; after three days of fun and games. As a result my normal motivation is considerably lacking and it has harmonized itself without standard time. &nbsp;        &nbsp;        Joe and I managed to sneak in a photo shoot at an undisclosed location and came away with some great shots. I am quite happy with them and hopefully will publish a couple on here. &nbsp;        &nbsp;        Regarding the rave review I had given last week about a swim practice I had attended &#8211; well, I attended practice number two last night and left with another great feeling of accomplishment. A swim meet is coming up in October and gives me a potential goal to reach. I have no doubt in my training and swimming abilities to be ready for the meet (it&#8217;s in     Ft.   Lauderdale    ,     FL    ) but meets in general have always terrified me. The nerves beforehand become uncontrollable to the point of nausea and shaking. Is it worth putting myself though the turmoil for a sense of accomplishment? Or should I just focus on the immediate health benefits I receive from swimming regularly? It&#8217;s something to ponder for the next few months or so.         &nbsp;        &nbsp;     ',\n",

At lunch today, all the usual lunch cronies were otherwise occupied, so I went to Whataburger (read it slowly) and read in the Bible Exodus 13:17-15:21 for teaching on Sunday. In particular, Exodus 14:14 stuck out to me:      The   Lord will fight for you while you keep silent    .

       " '                               Few people are true connoisseurs of junk food, like myself.    I personally only know of one other person who likes to eat icing straight out the tub – my best friend Shannon.       And not just a spoonful here or a spoonful there.    I’m talking eating the entire tub of icing.    I’m even talking about deliberately making  urlLink homemade butter crème icing  specifically with the purpose of sitting and eating the entire bowlful with a spoon by yourself.    It happens to be one of my favorite things to do.            Yes, I realize how grossly horrible that sounds…and sometimes, it is.    I mean, who eats lard by the spoonful?    Well, I do.  When I’ve plopped myself down on the couch with a bowl of icing…its me who doing that (technically).    Not to mention, I’m sure eating icing doesn’t exactly help me keep off the pounds or keep my cholesterol down.    But it just tastes  so good  to me.  From the first fluffy, heavenly bite...all the way to scrapping the bowl for tiny sweet moments, I savor each and every spoonful. And even if I were to get the slightest bit sick of the sweetness, I would simply take a sip of the champagne glass (that inevitably sits nearby) to cleanse my palate.             However, I usually can eat quite a bit of junk food and still not get sick of it.    Most normal people get sick of junk food pretty quick.    And I remember a time long, long ago when I, too, was one of those people.    But around third or fourth grade…I started realizing that I really liked junk food.    Cakes, ice cream, cupcakes, wafer bars, chocolate bars.    I had so many favorites, not just one!          By the time I was fourteen, I realized I may have taken my love for junk food a bit too far as I noticed that I never lost the babyfat that my surrounding friends had lost.    But did that stop me?    No way!    I just quickly realized I would one day have to be a dieter if I was going to be able to enjoy the foods that I cherished.                      My love for junk food is still so strong even now...even when I see that I am in a battle.    Constantly fighting little wars.    One day I am eating doughnuts and cake and drinking champagne and laughing and happy.    The next I am eating only certain foods under a certain amount of calories and swearing junk food off.   Never again!   I will say.   Never will I eat poorly again...from now on its fruit, vegetables, and fish!   And then, I see a picture of a pretty cake or a bubbling glass of champagne and can’t resist the urge to make a batter of icing or head to the local H.E.B. and pick out my favorite sparkling wine.    Too bad I couldn’t just live off cake and champagne and be healthy.  :(              ',\n",

       " '                               How Microsoft Develops and Releases Software Patches      By Jeffrey R. Jones, Senior Director, Microsoft Security  Business Unit       When we launched our first security newsletter in December, I asked you to  send me your comments and feedback so that I could be your advocate at Microsoft  for security issues\\x97and you delivered! I appreciate the many e-mail messages  with comments and questions, and we will begin answering them this month.   One particular question raised by many of you focused around the Microsoft  process for patching known vulnerabilities. This is an important topic to many  of you, so this month I will describe the lifecycle of a software vulnerability  from time of disclosure until a patch and Security Bulletin release.   The Microsoft security response process follows the general steps of  reporting, investigation, development, test, and release.   The security response process starts with the reporting of a potential issue.  Microsoft uses our membership in the  Organization for Internet Safety   to strongly promote the principles of responsible reporting. A central principle  is the belief that the best way to minimize customer risk is for security  researchers to work closely with vendors to identify issues and fix them before  they are publicized.   When Microsoft releases a patch concurrently with an announcement of a  vulnerability, it is a result of having identified the issue and worked through  the patch release process prior to communicating publicly. This means our  customers will have an opportunity to protect themselves from malicious hackers  seeking to exploit the vulnerability. However, when vulnerabilities are  announced publicly at the same time Microsoft is notified, customers remain  exposed to malicious attackers.   Once a potential issue is reported to Microsoft, either privately or  publicly, our team immediately begins an investigation to reproduce and verify  the reported issue and to identify any associated or variant issues.  Historically, only about 1 out of 10 reported issues turns out to be a new and  unique security issue that warrants opening an investigation, while the other 9  fall into categories of known issues, non-security issues, or errors.   If an issue is replicable, a priority is assigned to it and potential fixes,  mitigations, and workarounds are developed. We\\x92ve learned over time that  mitigations and workarounds are very important for empowering users to control  when and how they manage their risk. Chartered with defining and implementing  the process for responding to reported software security issues, the Microsoft  Security Response Center works closely with the affected product group to do  this investigation, and, further, to expand the investigation to other supported  versions of products so that we can gain a complete understanding of how an  issue may affect customers.   One of the most challenging elements of this process is testing. It is  critical to our customers that whatever changes we make to a product have little  to no impact on existing installations and applications. For a product such as  Internet Explorer, for example, the breadth can be significant. Microsoft  currently supports three major versions of Internet Explorer (5.01, 5.5, 6)  across several minor versions (for example, Internet Explorer 6 \\x93gold\\x94 and  Service Pack 1) across several operating systems (Windows 98, Windows Me,  Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003) for more than 25 languages.  In total, to fix one Internet Explorer issue, Microsoft builds and releases more  than 400 unique packages, tested on an even larger number of combinations.   Complementary to taking these steps to help customers more ably protect  themselves from malicious attackers, the Security Response Center and Security  Business Unit offer outreach programs and prescriptive guidance through our Web  properties, through support channels, and directly through our interactions with  customers.   Most importantly, what this means to us is that, even as we are driving  urgently for timely delivery of a patch for serious security issues, we are  motivated to focus as much on the \\x93quality\\x94 part as the \\x93timely\\x94 part so that we  can deliver the quality and protection our customers demand. It is essential  that each patch installs properly, addresses the security issue, and does not  disrupt other existing functionality. It is a job Microsoft takes very  seriously.

       " \"                               I had been practicing my singing techniques since I spontaneously joined the class because of my friend Sara. I love singing , I've been singing since I was five. At one point, I though I was going to go on Star Search. That didn't happen but nonetheless I still do it as a hobby. It is important that when you sing, you practice, don't drink or eat dairy on the day of the performance, smile, take constructive critism, and most importantly have fun. So on the day of the performance I had invited Pete but he didn't come and I knew it. I wasn't hurt just disappointed but I still sang my little heart out. I met Sara's boyfriend who is twice her age but doesn't look it. She loves him and that is that. I felt bad that my mother couldn't make it because The Giants were playing that day. She did however gave me emotional support and instead Sara's mom and stepfather were there and since I know them I asked them to not only support her but me as well. I had accomplished a lot in that day. In a matter of two and half hours with support from my aunt Nanci. I bought me a shirt to use for choir, buy refreshments, pay some bills, and go home and get dress for the event. The potluck went well and the performance was great. The choir got to perform three times.      I was proud of this certain singer, he had been a more horific car accident than I and still had the warmth and personality to perform, 'What A Wonderful World' And 'America The Beautiful'. Everyone cheer and cry at the same time. It was so emotional.     Later that night I got a ride home with Sara and her boyfriend, Doug, to my house. I am an eternal optimist and it was great nonetheless. I have one more performance until school is over.      \",\n",

First off, I didn't go to bed until 4 something this morning and my mom wakes me up at 11 to go with her to the hospital to drop some files off. So I go with her, then I come home and Brian calls and tells me they're going to Astroworld and can I go. I asked my dad and ofcourse because I have cleaning to do I couldn't go. So Brian went without me and I got stuck home cleaning. Then, around 2:45 my mom comes home, I tell her what happened and she talks to my dad and then he said I could go. Well, I new Brian had left already, but I called anyway, they left. So I got stuck here cleaning when I could have gone and had fun for once. Im so mad. First Im mad at my dad, I mean thats a given. But then I'm kind of mad at Brian. I mean I know I shouldn't be, but I am. I feel like he just left me. I know that if my family invited me and Brian couldn't come, I'd stay. Hell Im still trying to get out of going to Colorado (which I love and want to move there one day) just so I can be with him. I know I shouldn't be mad, but I just can't help but feel that I was left. We never get to do anything fun and then the one thing and my dad says no, but then changes his mind After they left. And if my dad wouldn't have made me go with my mom then I probably would have been done cleaning and could have gone. I don't know if Im going to see Brian today. Thats another thing that makes me mad is this is our Saturday, we only get 2 days of the week to stay out until midnight and now he wasted our entire day and probably won't get back until 10 tonight knowing them. God Im just so mad. I hate everyone and everything. Then I went to Sally's Beauty Supply to see if they had the hair dye I want (purple) but my mom said that it wouldn't take on my hair so I didn't get it and I have to wait to find some better stuff. Nothing can ever just go right. Something or SOMEONE always fucks things up for me. Nothing is ever good enough. I swear. I take care of 2 disable parents, practically do everything..clean the house all the time, get them food, get their medicine, run all over the place getting shit for them, fix them food, bring them drinks, take out the trash, do their laundry...I mean all I want is to sometimes go out even if I have cleaning and do it later. I Always do what they ask me to when they ask me to. I stay up late and they wake me up early, but I get up for them. I mean basically I bow down to them and answer their beckon call. I just want a little bit of sleep and a little bit of fun. Im only 16 and I need a break. But, that doesn't matter. Im just feeling sorry for myself. But, atleast Im writing it down and getting it out so I dont complain to Brian or my friends about it. That way I can complain to people that I dont know and dont care about if they think Im selfish and spoiled and ungrateful (my dad). This is pathetic its Saturday and its almost 7:30pm and Im doing nothing. I should call Sabrina..but I know if I do Brian probably won't be Happy, although why should I care, he couldn't wait on me, so why should I wait on him to get back? Why should I waste my whole day why he's having fun. Fuck that. Maybe Ill call Sabrina, I don't know. Later Maggots.                 \",\n",

'I can honestly say that no one deserved this more than Kobe,' said Los Angeles starting center Shaquille O’Neal. 'The little freak should do us all a favor and take the trophy's suggestion. But out of all the pervs in the Lakers' line-up, Kobe is by far the most talented athletically.'     The gutless worm is currently standing trial in Eagle, Colo. for the rape and sexual assault of a hotel employee. An insistent coward who refuses to own up to his repugnant actions, Bryant entered a plea of not guilty.     The MVP award was presented before a capacity crowd at the Staples Center yesterday afternoon. Child molester and musician R.

       " \"                               Speaking of Segues...   Vivid dreams flood my mind as I slip steadily to wake.  The first thing I notice is how beautiful the light is in my room.  I destroyed my blinds last night while cleaning, so in it's place, I put up a thin green silk-sheet to block out the day.  But instead it filtered beautiful soft green light throughout the room.  It felt like walking in a forest through mist and all the imagery that entails.  Today, waking up was special, it's not always that way.  Today I felt purpose from the moment my eyes were opened.  The universe softly nudged me awake, because the day was too big to wait for me.  I love feeling purpose.  I love feeling needed, and that's how I've felt all day.  And I haven't had that in a really long time.    I started the day by sleepily returning a call from a friend needing a ride.  I drove her and her 5 year old daughter to where they needed to go.  I think every person should have the privilege of being friends with a child.  The innocence and laughter that they remind us is in ourselves cannot be matched by anything.  The reward I get from making a little kid laugh is worth more than any book I've ever published or painting I've ever sold.  I look forward to waking up to my own giggling offspring some day.  Some day... but probably not some day soon.  But it was a wonderful way to begin my day.  I feel at peace now.  I know it's only temporary.  But I find stength in the lessons I've learned the last few months, and it feels like there is much more peace on the way.    There's only a handful of things that need to be finished with organizing my home.  But the designs are all completed.  There's no thinking left to be done.  The relief  that  brings to me is immeasurable.  I've felt crippled so many times these last 4 months because there was so much I had to do... before I could even begin.  It can be so overwhelming.  And now, with a couple nights of work, it's all done.  And all I have to do from now on is maintain it.  I don't know why it took me so long to understand this simple way.  I'm glad I didn't move to San Diego when I was hoping to.  I think learning all this about myself would have been so much harder there.  But if the rest of the year goes as well as the first part has, then I should be more than ready to take on that whole new world.   --Will                \",\n",

Bill made what I feel was an erroneous statement--He claimed that 'liberal' has a negative connotation in our society, but 'conservative' doesn't. I am not sure where Bill lives, but it sure ain't in Philly (bad gammar used purposely for effect). Being a conservative in Philadelphia is a risky proposition --espcially when you have 'Bush/Cheney '04' on the back of your vehicle. I have been flipped off, growled at, cut off (so the driver behind me can get in front of me to make sure I see his 'Like Father Like Son -One Term and You're Done' bumper sticker), and tailed late at night by hulking men in those tiny almost-trucks (AKA union thugs)...You name it -it's happened. So, I reject the notion that 'conservative' is an ideology that is widely accepted and embraced... That train of thought dropped me off here: Liberals often object to general terms being used: such as 'terrorist' or 'homicide bomber'...I have been advised on numerous occasions to understand that the 'opposition' is another human being. They say that if we 'understand' them, we won't dehumanize them --and subsequently demonize them. So, in an attempt to make myself 'more human' --and detract from the moniker of 'angry right-wing blonde' --I will divulge a bit of personal information. That being said --this was inspired by JustRose who thinks I need to expose my underbelly a bit more (to prove that it doesn't have scales on it).  1. I might as well get this right out of the way...I love fruitcake. Not just the expensive kind with the real pineapples and almonds, but even the cheap gooey stuff with those disgusting green things in it.  2. I love lists .  I have been known to make lists of lists that I need to write.  3. I smoke.  It is my one vice and I love it.  4. I don't drink.  Not out of a religious conviction -or a 'recovering' problem...I just don't like it.  5. I watch the Sound of Music at least six times a year.  6. One of the only foods that I actually  crave  is Peanut Butter Captain Crunch.  7. I am obsessive about matching -even undergarments or pajamas (what if there was a fire?) --This causes me to have to switch handbags everytime I change.  8. I have a Coach Bag fetish...I have a lot (which helps with fact #7). I sometimes go into the Coach store just to inhale the leather.  9. I also have a 'soft t-shirt' fetish. I have been known to fondle t-shirts...even if there is someone in them. (James Pearce and C&C -ALa71 tested &amp; approved)  10. The name choices for my second son were Dionysus or Bronte...proving that it is not always beneficial to be the child of an English major. We named him Mason.  11. One entire room of my house is adorned in Marilyn Monroe memorabilia.  12. I am only 5'2 and I have never wished that I was taller.  13. In high school I played field hockey, softball and was a cheerleader.  I once got MVP.  14. My son, Justice , and I walk for miles on the beach early in the morning to pick up trash.  15. I still watch 'The Real World' and 'Road Rules' (OK, so I have 2 vices)  16. My youngest son wants to be 'popcorn' when he grows up.  17. I have a very silly sense of humor --during the most heated arguements, if my husband says something ridiculous ('squishy underpants') I find it impossible to stay mad.  18. I have met Sean Hannity twice...a picture of me, him, and my boys will live forever on my refrigerator.  19. I love dogs with no noses: pugs, frenchies, bulldogs and mastiffs. I feel guilty about it, but I don't like mixed-breeds (but I have been bit badly twice -both times a mixed-breed). We have a Freedom Bulldog named 'Tink'...  20. I often sing into my round brush while I am driving --this embarasses my husband to death!          \",\n",

       " \"                              &nbsp;      Woman healed of 4th stage cancer      In Dec. of 1990 I was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the age of 39. The  doctors could give me no hope. I did have chemo and radiation, the doctors  thought that could prolong my life for a little while. In March of 1991 I had  surgery, thats when they found that the cancer had spread to my lymp nodes in my  right hip area and couldn't get it all with the surgery. Now it looked like 3-6  months is all I would live. It was a very aggressive form of colorectal  cancer.  While searching through the Bible, my mom and I found so many  promises on healing, in the old and new testament. I started writing them in a  notebook and those precious scriptures filled up pages and pages! In Hebrews  13:8 it is written that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever!  So if Jesus healed then, He could heal me now because also in Acts 10:34 it is  written that He is no respector of persons! Proverbs 4:20-22 says; My son, pay  attention to what I say, listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your  sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and  healing and health to all their flesh. The Hebrew word for 'health' is medicine.  So I started taking God's Word like medicine every day. In fact thats what I  titled my notebook of all those precious scriptures 'GODS MEDICINE'.  It  was three years before the doctors finally gave me a good report. It was  certainly not an overnight miracle. There was a lot of pain and ups and downs  but, His Grace was sufficient. Jesus let me know that I was in the middle of  spiritual warfare, the devil wanted to kill me (John 10:10) and He wanted to  heal me for His glory. Jesus specializes in the hard cases!  He revealed  to me that in Matthew chapter 14, when Peter got out of the boat with his eyes  fixed on Jesus he could walk on the water but when Peter took his eyes off Jesus  and looked at the storm around him, he sank. So I, must keep my eyes focused on  Him and His Word and not on the storm of cancer all around me (the doctors  reports, test results, the pain, what other people said). He is so faithful to  His Promsies! There were so many different things that happened during this time  and afterwards but this is the story in brief. I give Jesus my Lord and Savior  all the glory and praise for healing me of 4th stage cancer.              \",\n",

Last Wednesday night I went to see  The Passion of the Christ . I sat for two emotionally draning hours, watching the most horrifically beautiful film I have ever seen. I was transfixed on the screen, I couldnt physically move, or even cry.  All I did was sit and experince it.  After it was over, I just sat there...trying to digest what I had just seen.  I was silent for about 30 minutes after it was over. I couldnt even talk about the movie, I was so affected by it. Thos images are burned into my brain forever, and I am grateful for it. Christ's love for a horrible person like me.....it amazes me. I don't know why He saw something in me that made all that suffering worth it. I am an unfaithful whore, more focused on what makes ME  happy, than what God would have me do.  I wouldn't have died for somone as ungrateful as I am.   Yet something else resonates beyond all the suffering Christ went through: love. He did all of that..because He loved me, and everyone else in the world. I feel so unworthy of that love, it's something that I take for granted every day I live.  Thankfully, God's grace is unending, and thats how I can continue to go on.  Dispite all my failures (and there are many), He looks beyond all of that and loves me anyways. It's beautiful, and humbling at the same time. Watching  The Passion  really put me in my place, in a sense anyways.  I can still close my eyes and see the blood and hear the whips and the hammers. It was an amazing experince seeing this film, and I do not have the words to discribe it. All I can say is how it has affected me. God's hand was on this movie, and everyone should go see this film. It is bloody, violent and very hard to watch, but go see it.  If this film doesn't move you, and make you re-evaluate things, then your way more stubborn in your ways than I am.  Go see it, and give me some feedback on what your thoughts are.         \",\n",

       " \"                              Brighter Meadows - Melting Sunsets   Some days you know who you are, and some days you can't remember your name.  And then there's lately, where I can't understand the man I used to be.  I've been rereading some of my old posts, and though the words sound sweet and beautiful, I no longer understand or relate to them.   I can't believe that I've changed so much so quickly.  But now the loneliness just seems so foreign to me.  I truly had fallen in love with being lonely.  I wanted to understand why though.  And I think I've found the answer, and of course it goes hand in hand with all the other stuff I've been figuring out.    My one and only previous relationship, was a fairly good one.  We loved each other very much.  And in my mind it was a very successful relationship - well, as successful as an ended relationship can be.  We are still very good friends, and will probably always be.  But looking back now, I realize that I was looking for her to complete me.  I was only half of a person, and I wanted her to make me whole.  And when the relationship ended - most likely from an subconscious awareness that I was needy and incomplete - no matter how well I tried to hide it - I was unwilling to move on  because  I was incomplete, and somewhere in me I think I was waiting to magically  become  complete without any sort of work or introspection on my part.  But it never happened.  And I wanted to hold onto whatever relationship success I'd had, just so I could look back and say that someone loved me, or that I wasn't bad at relationships, or some other such lameness.    Really what it was... I wanted to avoid my own happiness.  I wasn't ready to be happy, because I wasn't thin, wasn't successful, or because I wasn't with the perfect woman, blah blah blah.  The same excuses I've been talking about all week.  And really, I  loved  the feeling of being lonely.  Though it was very subconscious I just wanted sympathy - from my friends - from my ex - from anyone that would listen.  I craved the attention.  So I wanted to remain in my ignorance and wallow in sadness for as long as I could.  What better way to put off being happy - than to be sad!   You complete me...   I loved that line from Jerry Mcquire.  It made the whole movie for me.  Especially the way it was built up.   Cuba catching the ball, Tom Cruise running home, 'you had me at hello', yada yada yada...  But now it just doesn't taste the same.  I guess I have a different perspective on things.  I don't want someone to complete me anymore.  Because it insinuates that I am not already a complete whole person - and that neither is anyone that would have me.  If you want to get literal - multiply two halves - you get one quarter.  Even if you  added  two halves you'd still only have one person.  That sucks.  I see that now, and I see a lot of what I was waiting around for was because of that skewed logic.  I mean it would be one thing, if we were both looking for someone else to complete each other, you really have to be committed to this sort of thing.  And it may work out - but like true love - its one in a million.  So I want to be a whole person now.  I want to be responsible for my own emotions, and my own actions.  I want to be complete.  And I want that in whoever I spend my life with.  I want someone that makes me better than whole.  And best of all, I want someone that is that way herself.  But we're not perfect, none of us are.  I sure as hell am not.  I'm just now stepping into the hall of maturity, to take a curious look around, hoping someday soon I will know this place like my own home.     She's a jar.. with a heavy lid...   So where does that put me now, with my current relationship.  Really it changes nothing.  Those expectations of being with a complete, whole, person (and vice versa), will never change for me.  But those expectations are for the woman I will marry.  If she grows into those things, as I hope to one day do myself, all the better.  If not, I still very much enjoy being with her.  And it's easier to enjoy a person as they are, without imposing some sort of unreasonable expectations - like them making  you  complete.  For now, I'm just happy.  I'm comfortable with someone, that's something I've never experienced with another human being.  And as long as we are happy and making healthy choices in the relationship, and continuing to grow, and continuing to put 'true' intimacy before 'sexual' intimacy... we will be fine.    'No worries.. No expectations.. Having fun.'   --Will                       \",\n",

I always have. I guess it's in my blood; my family has a long line of teachers. My grandfather was not only a teacher, but he was even superintendent of a school district. So it's just in my nature. But I rarely feel worthy of the mantle. It has always felt like I was someone that knew just a little more about some things than those around me, but I had some minute difference in my genetic make-up that puts a wild-hare up my ass to make me think I should share what I know. But today was different. Everything was clear. The words came with ease, phrasing and re-phrasing to pass along little nuggets of knowledge. And for the first time I felt like I truly had a firm grasp on not only drawing anatomy, but teaching it. Michelangelo I am not. But I am definitely far from where I was the first time I attempted to share my wisdom.     Anyways, I try to remain humble about this all. It often seems like the moment I feel I have a grasp on something, the substance changes and it sifts through my fingers. But a small part of me finds great pride in the fact, that some of these kids might one day become one of the greats of our industry. And they'll look back on their lives and say 'that guy' helped me do this. I guess a legacy of sorts. I am the hopeless optimist. Finding potential in every seed. Doing what I can to nurture and provide what I know for it to grow. In hopes that one day I may sit in the shade of some great oak that lasts through the ages.     Then again... maybe its just what I always wanted for myself.        --Will                   \",\n",

So I've only been getting in 2 weight workouts a week instead of 3, and I've been slacking on those.  I've got to get back to where my body is craving it.  Swimming is still going well, I've been every day that I was supposed to.  And I haven't started running yet, mostly because it's fricking cold.  But I gave myself two weeks to start into running, so I've still got a shot next week.  Diet has been good.  Even though there hasn't been enough food in the house this week I've stayed pretty consistent.  There was a very nasty incident with some sweet and sour chicken and an all night binge with burger king, beer and chocolate sauce earlier this week.. But we won't talk about that.  Overall the diet seems pretty stable.  My major weaknesses seem to be less of a problem.  There's been no late nights at EZ mart with DR pepper and Candy bars then driving around feeling stoned.  Burger king was a one time thing.  It didn't mean anything.. honest it didn't.  And my craving for raw vegetables cannot be sated, which is a good sign that the balance has tipped from craving highfat/highcarb stuff to craving healthy foods.  Never thought that would happen.  I've decided that I will probably keep more accurate accounts of what I eat, and how I exercise each day and list it up here.  I was afraid of mixing it too much with the rest of my writing.  But this is the most important thing in my life right now.  This is my number one goal this year, to lose weight and get in shape.  And I need to hold myself more accurately accountable.  I'll try to keep it on the DL though so I don't get  '..and he died in her arms...'  followed by  '...and I ate 3 bananas and a taco.'    --Will                  \",\n",

       " '                              For the first time since1986, I have  lived in the same house for over three years! Ironically,         Taipei        is a place I anticipated only staying in for about 6 months… so I rented a  furnished house as a temporary base. It came complete with all the former  family’s trappings. As you enter the apartment, your eye is struck by a HUGE  family shrine. It sits under a massive triptych of important Buddhist (?)  figures… One that must be    Guanyin , one that appears to be  Damou  ( Daruma  in Japanese)  and  another… all rendered in big black brushstrokes with finer detailing  in read and gold. The effect is quite imposing… if I can get my digital camera  fixed, I will attach a photo at some point. You MUST see this! It is no ordinary  household shrine. The closets are also stuffed with various boxes, trophies,  photos and other old things. The bookshelves contain old piano sheet music, an  assortment of Chinese literature and, funnily enough, a small English  collection: medical books, and a few erotic novels accompanied by some sensual  massage/sex manuals. Actually, the initial attraction to the apartment was the  piano sheet music and the piano (see October archives – soggy soundboards…), but  about 6 months ago, the landlady’s youngest sister took the piano away.             &nbsp;     The rest of the apartment is very  spacious and open: high ceilings, white walls, ceilings and ceramic floor tiles…  big windows. The furnishings consist of a  hodge   podge  of old style bamboo and wood varieties. I rent a room  and the other rooms are rented out to other women (currently one woman from       Southern  Taiwan      and one Japanese woman). The  landlady feels it is still her home and enters unannounced when she feels like  it…. Recently not so often, but more regularly when her parents visit (they live  in LA) as her mother comes to pray at the shrine. Funnily enough, I don’t mind  this, the mother is old enough that she has survived Japanese rule and we can  communicate easily using Japanese. She is friendly and reasonable. Her  daughters, on the other hand, are stingy and difficult. Maybe that is why the  parents choose to live in LA.          &nbsp;     Anyway, the youngest daughter- the  one who “stole” the piano- wants to save money by moving her family to her  parents’ home. So that means we all have to vacate. I hate to move again with so  little time left in       Taiwan      …  as usual, I have the dilemma of whether to think of this as temporary or… Truth  be told, I find I live more happily when I think of my residence as   home   rather  than   temporary dwelling  place  . But if work doesn’t slow down, I may have to use an agency to  do my house hunting for me… or move to a business hotel. Not  good!                 ',\n",
       " \"                              I Don't Care if Nobody Loves Me           After tomorrow night, film history will be made. Perhaps the most violent most sadistic film ever made will hit theaters, and the churches will be there in the thousands. I have followed the production of  The Passion of the Christ  ever since Mel Gibson announced his plans last year.  The buzz around this film is mind-numbing sometimes. It seems like everyone has something to say about it, and I have read at least 300 articles on this thing in the past 5 months.  I think that Mel Gibson has given us a wonderful gift, and God has blessed this production immensely. The biggest question that people seem to wonder about would be : Is the film Anti-Semitic? That's total bullshit! I have only heard that argument once a few years ago, and I found it laughable.  So to even hear the ADL and Mr. Foxman complain about Gibson's movie, it makes me sick to my stomach.  Now, are the Jews responsible for killing Jesus? No, the human race is responsible. The Bible clearly states our depravity and our need for God. Christ willingly let Himself be arrested, scourged, condemned and crucified, all for the sake of mine and your sins.  Now if you want to get technical, the Jewish Sanhedrin conspired to kill Jesus, and Pilate gave the order to crucify Him, however, this does not give anyone right to constitute blame to one, or any specific people group.  I wouldn't blame the Jews as a people group for killing Jesus, any more than I would blame the Germans for the Holocaust.      Now, as of late I have been reading about all these Churches renting out theaters on opening night. It seems at least around my area that if you don't belong to a local church, your shit outta luck in going to see The Passion for the next few days. If you cannot tell, this idea bothers me . Heres why.........this movie, although blatantly Christian, was not made in order for evangelicals to finally get off their asses and go to the movies. It was not made for churches to rent out theaters for their congregations to have a Wednesday night service! It was not made 'for us, by us', even though I think every christian should be out there supporting this film. I just don't think renting out movie theaters is the way to go about it. Pay your admission prices and stand in line like everyone else!  By this next statement, many of you will promptly disagree with me, but I do not think that we christians should be trying to claim this film for ourselves.  Here is what I mean by that: Modern christian cinema has given us badly written, candy coated shit like  Left Behind  and  The Omega Code .  They shy away from being realistic for fear of being offensive, or worse...Receiving an 'R' rating. And we all know that good christians do not go see R- rated films, beacause they are evil.  (Let's just casually ignore the fact that the Bible is R-rated in some parts, and sex, murder, and violence is  frequently in it's pages) So we have traded realism for a false pharisee-like morality, when it comes to film.  There is no one in the ' christian' film industry that would have had the balls to make  The Passion  the way that Gibson has done. I think all the media influences would have shut the project down, God forbid we offend someone.  Maybe I am being too harsh and perhaps even offensive to some, but my view is....someone has to.  I do not like, nor support the idea of modern evangelicals renting out movie theaters and making witnessing packs in conjuction with the release of the film.  Praise the film . Go see the film . Take unsaved people to see the film. But let the power of the Gospel do it's job, you don't have to ease it along.  Gibson's film, from what I can tell, presents  the Gospel in a remarkable way, using one of the most effective mediums in our modern world. No one will leave this film unchanged. Visually, the trailers have given me chills, and I know that this will be the most moving portrayal of Christ that has ever been produced, and I strongly feel like we need to let the Gospel speak for itself.                       The truth is never sexy, so it's not an easy sell                   You can dress her like the culture, and she'll shock em just as well                   She don't need an apology for being who she is                   And she don't need your help making enemies.                                              -Derek Webb                                  \",\n",

       " \"                              Junoon_____over the years 1991 saw the birth of a new Pakistani band,Junoon.Only this time the birth was different.Junoon wasn't just another band, it was 'the' band. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I called them a 'revolutionary' band. They entered the mainstream at the time when jhankar ruled, hideous rip-offs such as baby-yeah(remember sajjad ali?) were super hits and the word 'rock' was alien to 90% of our population. They are indeed the pioneers of Pakistani rock. While mummy daddies refused to recognize junoon's efforts as 'music', a larger part of the youth embraced junoonism. To them junoon was a passion that became more intense with each album. Although its roots lie in Pakistan, Junoon has enjoyed fame and success all over the world, courtesy the international music channels such as V and MTV that pampered it every now and then. The band was successful enough to create a new genre in Pakistan, the Sufi rock. With music inspired by Jimmy Hendrix, Jeff Black, Led Zeppelin and U2 and lyrics of great mystic poets such as Bulley Shah, Rumi, Ghalib and Iqbal, Junoon created a fusion that rocked the nation. (And a lot of other stuff too*wink*) Junoon's music is not categorized. It covered a wide range of topics in its music, from politics to the rise and fall of the taliban; they spoke up for all in their songs. Their bluntness and boldness added to their charms. They mustered up the guts in the time where media was anything but 'free'. The band began their work in 1990, when it comprised of Ali Azmat as the vocalist,Salman Ahmed the acoustic and electrical guitarist cum back up vocalist and Nusrat Hussain on the bass guitar. Their first album, Junoon, did not manage to hit the skies. It was highly criticized on, which isn't anything out of the blues for a new set up in Pakistan. It takes some time for us to get over the past and move on with something new all the time isn't it? The album Junoon, nonetheless, had some amazing tracks that were recognized in the later years such as Heer, Neend ati nahi and Rangoon main khoya. The negative response did not make Junoon lose all hopes. A year later, after bidding farewell to Nusrat Hussain and welcoming Brian o Connell as the bass guitarist, Junoon came up with their second album 'Talaash', a truck and roll album which funny to think was sponsored by close up. It was Brian's first album but his finesse didn't come until the third album, Inquilaab, released in 1995.Inquilab was no doubt the strongest pillar for Junoon.It proved their strength and rocked the Paki music scene with the smashing hit such as Husan waloon, Khwaab, Heeray and Saeein.Junoon was now a stable hit in Pakistan. In 1996 the cricket world cup saw a rise of a patriotic song 'Jazba Junoon' that became an instant hit with the already crazed stalker cricket fans. The sales of their album, soared high and now their fan following included people of all ages, not just teeny boppers. The video for their religious devotion based song, Saeen managed to change the opinions of many critics including the country's so-called mullahs. The fifth album came out in 1997.Named Kashmakash, it again hit the top charts but this surely wasn't the best there was to Junoon.The band broke all previous records and entered the international market when their album 'Azadi' was released. The head banging, typical rock style was so in, it gave all parents the freaks yet nothing could stop the growing fame of Junoon.Songs such as Khudi, Meree awaz sunoo and Yar bina were widely acclaimed and junoon became a household name. Junoon received  appreciation and acknowledgement even from the neighboring India, which was incredible, keeping in view the relations of the two countries at that time. The band won a golden disc for Azaadi at an international music channel awards after sharing the stage with top class international bands such as Pearl Jam, Oasis, Bush and the likes.  Their video for the song 'ehtesaab' focused on our corrupt politicians and was ,as expected, banned from our local TV stations. The then P.M of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, banned the band claiming it was due to the promotion of jeans and long hair in Pakistani culture but it was a widely known fact that the ban was inflicted since Junoon refused to sing for his 'karz utaro mulk sawaro' scheme and did the song 'ehtesaab' with imran khan instead. The ban did not dampen their spirits, Junoon carried on with their promotion for peace. The band maintained a consistent ethical rectitude. Record sales were the highest for Azadi and it remains to be the king of all albums. The next album Parvaaz was by far superior to anything junoon had ever made. The production was flawless and the album had a complete theme and songs that seem liked they belonged. Plus it had ghoom, the epic. The song that had single-handedly defined junoon's greatness. Too bad the album did not do well in India. That got Junoon wondering what the hell happened and ever since they are clutching to the old fame which is somewhat fading away. The Pakistani music scene has gone much mature in the past 13 years and the audience has a vast choice now. With innumerable bands sailing in the sea, Junoon has a lot more competiton. Their next albums did not carry out the old charm and failed to impress the Junoonis. No wonder there were so many converts from 'junoonism'.Junoon's music now is more commercial than ever and now with the different directions and ali azmat's solo tracks out, there is not much doubt left about the 'stability' of the band. Their latest album deewar was no help to the falling repute and fame of the band, instead it made the fall deeper and with a louder 'thud'. Everything aside, Junoon has made its name written in gold in the Pakistani music history. With over 20 million records selling world wide, the band did play their fair share in making Pakistan proud. Many of us Junoonis have grown up with Junoon's music. It has been a part of us for over 13 years and it is no wonder we feel a sense of loyalty towards the band. We do miss 'our' junoon, the one that lacked commercialism. Every Junooni has a Junoon moment, and in return Junoon has a song for every situation in our life. There is a fondness for Junoon in our hearts for it has been with us for long. Funny how their music inspired us and changed our lives yet we never got to thank them. So here I do it finally, All hail to Junoon, for being what they are and for playing their part in our lives. And of course, for also making us realize there is more to ‘music’ than some do dee daa crap. Junoon rocks!!!          \",\n",

And I think this one is much closer to my heart's desire.  My friend Brandon wrote one of these way back in the day, and he's carried it around in his wallet all this time.  Well he got married a couple weeks ago to a really wonderful woman... so the idea can't be all that bad.      Who she is...  She loves me.  She loves me almost more than I love her.  She loves like a child, completely, unconditionally, happily.  And she loves  me  in that way.  She inspires me.  She makes me want to be more than I already am.  She inspires me to push myself harder and farther than I ever imagined possible.    She laughs.  A lot.  She is funny and she makes me laugh as much as I make her (A lot).    She makes me better.  She actively works with me in my life to make me a better man.  I am better each day because of having her in my life.  She is my mirror.  She shows me my self, and lets me know what my strengths and weaknesses are.  She reflects all that I don’t see.  She understands me.  She understands my feelings, and reasoning, what makes me happy, the way I think and the way I laugh.  She is compassionate.  She comforts me and makes me comfortable.    She protects me.  She makes it safe for me to be vulnerable, and honest.  She is my harbor in any storm.  She is intelligent.  Probably more so than I, but that’s why I love her.  She understands all that I don’t, and I understand much that she doesn’t.  She is patient.  She knows I will make mistakes, but she is more than willing to be patient with me through all of those struggles.  She is happy.  She knows  what  makes her happy. And most importantly, she knows what she  needs  to be happy and how to get it.  She is sincere and honest.  I don’t have to guess at what she is thinking, she is honest completely and is sincere in all that she does and says.  She is confident.  She knows herself, she understands herself.  She is confident in what she can do, in what she knows, and in the ways that she carries herself.    She is competent.  She can live her own life if she needs.  She can accomplish any task on her own and doesn’t need someone else to do it for her.  But she wants me to be in her life and to help her with these things.  She is innocent, she still has her childish naivity about her and her childlike enthusiasm.  She is God's child.  She understands that not all things are in our hands.  And she knows when it's time to give it to God.  She is responsible.  She is accountable for her actions and emotions and responsiblities.    She is healthy.  She makes healthy choices, and lives in a healthy manner.  She is driven and passionate.  I have to work twice as hard just to keep up with her.  She is beautiful to me.  Inside and out she is beautiful to me.  …And I am all of these things for her too.   I know it's kind of long.  And probably too much.  But I know if I can be these things, then there's bound to be someone else out there that can as well.   --Will                 \",\n",

       " \"                              Tidal Wave   My friends lovingly joke that I'm like a tidal wave when it comes to working with - or loving - me.  And the sad part is that they are probably not far off.  The tidal wave; too much to be contained by the ocean, leaps from the sea, reaching out for the shore.  Wanting to share itself so badly with the world, with such power and enthusiasm that it crashes down upon them.  Often scaring them off or overwhelming them so much that they nearly drown.  I have great passion and intensity for those I love, and for what I do.  But it's a power often misunderstood and unfortunately often beyond my control.  I'm slowly learning to temper my passions, I'm trying to contain the overpowering flame, and use it to burn slowly through the nights.  Instead of consuming everything in it's path.  I've found myself having to heed my own advice.  'Keep it simple, keep it small.'  After the crash and burn that was  last summer , I find myself cautiously crawling out of my cave, peeking around the corners, trying slowly to move back into the world.    I find myself surprisingly nervous about tomorrow.  I mean it's only the flea market for chrissakes.  But I guess it's really more than that.  I haven't put myself out there since the studio.  I've been too worn and weary to live on the faith it takes to be self-employed.  And I sure as hell haven't done an event like this for more than a year.  Of course, it was such a stressful thing back then, even though, by the 4th month of the season I was starting to feel like a pro.  Knocking out 7 or 8 drawings an hour.  I think I did about 250 caricatures throughout the whole season.  Not bad for an amatuer.  So I'm starting small.  I'm only doing black and white this weekend, no airbrush, no big display, no professional signs or gimmicks.  Just me, my desk and the public.  I'll keep doing it this way until it feels like the right time to take the next step.  My hope is that by the time the fair season starts up again this summer I will be doing 50 - 100 drawings a day, and hopefully earn enough in those 3 months to last the next year.  But like I said... I need to start following my own advice. 'Keep it small, keep it simple.'  Keep bumbling to perfection.    --Will                      \",\n",
       " \"                              Today on MSN, I saw an update about the  Supersize Me  documentary done by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock. I just realized what a bad idea this was. This man ate nothing but McDonald's fast food for 30 days in a row. What kind of idiot............. Here is an article from  urlLink FilmmakerMagazine.com :  'Provocateur Michael Moore didn’t have anything to do with the Sundance sensation Super Size Me, but his methods were a major influence on New York City–based filmmaker Morgan Spurlock, whose funny and infuriating documentary feature examining the obesity epidemic in America took the Best Director prize in Park City earlier this year. In the film, Spurlock famously embarks on a 30-day diet of nothing but McDonald’s fast food, supersizing portions when offered and realizing shocking weight gain and potential liver damage as he interrogates doctors, lawyers, dieticians, school lunch program mavens, Big Mac connoisseurs and former government officials about fast-food consumption. Complete with an on-camera rectal examination and a gastric-bypass procedure, it’s a gross-out blend of endurance art and guerrilla muckraking that Spurlock hopes will change America’s thinking about what it eats. Sundance audiences ate it up, guffawing at an animated sequence featuring Ronald McDonald frolicking with tots to the tune of Curtis Mayfield’s “Pusherman” and retching during the obligatory projectile-vomiting scene starring Spurlock’s Happy Meal. It seems only a matter of time before Spurlock’s handlebar mustache becomes as recognizable as Moore’s copious gut.   This man destroyed his health trying to prove something we already knew. Fast Food is bad for you. And it will be, until Americans lear the meaning of the word ' urlLink Moderation '                  \",\n",

       " \"                             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-\\\\ I'm  sorry to hear he's passed. But I have to say that he illustrates something  that's been kind of eating at me for a couple years now, the language of war  that permeates our culture. He doesn't look like a child who was wasting his  time fighting a disease, but like one who was living his life with a disease.  I'm sure he hoped a cure&nbsp;or at least supportive, life-extending therapies  would be discovered in time to help him and his mom and other folks with the  same condition, but he doesn't look and never came across as though&nbsp;he  spent a lot of time or energy *fighting* it. I guess it bugs me a little to hear  it put that way all the time (everything's a war or battle these days). Mattie  had such a sweet, gentle, loving spirit, it feels almost like it dishonors him  to think of him feeling ill toward his disease, especially when it was part of  what allowed him to reach so many. We've got the war on drugs, the war on terror  (*war* on a state of emotion :-|), wars on cancers and other diseases of all  kinds, we battle our weight, signs of aging, for and against various causes, we  never go gently or gracefully anymore as it's apparently ignoble to ever 'go  down' without a fight. (Funnily enough, since that's *exactly* what Jesus chose  to do that was *so* noble, to take his punishment with dignity and without  complaint or struggle, and it's most often those who follow him {not those who  walk with him as a friend and companion, but those who profess to believe in him  as savior} who use this language and take these fighting attitudes.) (Not *only*  Christians, but they're on the forefront of many, even most battles one way or  another.) How does one fight a disease anyway? Seems like a battle-oriented  mindset will only serve to perpetuate ill feelings which would only exacerbate  the general disease. I dunno. It's kind of nit-picky I know, but y'all know how  I feel about words, how they define our worlds and are one of the first steps in  manifestation.&nbsp;Seems like describing everything in terms of war would bring  about... well, pretty much what we've got in the world -&nbsp;division, strife,  contention and a general state of&nbsp;embattlement. It's part of what makes it  so hard for some to see what Bush is doing and what our military is doing  (which, by the way, is no surprise to anyone who's been around it for any length  of time) as the ugly, selfish behaviors they are, is that we've glorified the  ideal of battle for so long now that all they have to do is make the 'other  side' seem sufficiently evil and it becomes obvious that what we're doing is  right. Folks around here are saying now that, '... we oughta just nuke [the  Iraqis].' No regard there for the fact that the majority of people who'd die  would be civilians trying to live ordinary, everyday lives just like the  majority of people here, they're women, children, old folks, babies, men who  have nothing to do with any military effort except where they've become so  desperate that they feel they must do *something* and just despondent enough to  strap on a bomb and hope their action helps to wake us up to what we're doing.  It's sick. But these are the same people who say they'd kill other people for  minor offenses, never considering what a really strong statement that is. I  mean, we rejoice at the idea of killing *germs*, which is not only stupid since  germs are a necessary part of our world and nothing to be afraid of in  moderation but such an asinine thing to get puffed up about considering that  germs are tiny, essentially defenseless creatures. It's like people thinking  they're all that when they throw a rock at a cat and hit it or when they're mean  enough to a dog to make it the meanest one at the cage matches. (Dog fighting  rings are broken up here with some regularity, and that's a sick, sick thing.)  What kind of people take pride in those acts? The same kind of people who think  they're cool when they walk into a town with a machine gun and open fire,  ripping apart everything in sight including any available human being,  defenseless or not, just because they live in&nbsp;a country that we, in our  American pride and supposed&nbsp;moral and intellectual superiority, have  decided is inherently evil. Of course, it seems to be going unnoticed that  germs, tiny and essentially defenseless as they appear to be, are doing a fine  job of not only surviving but becoming stronger and more effective. If we choose  to continue on such a path we'll find, I think, that the same is true of the  people we consider so inconsequential that their lives don't matter. Or,  perhaps, we'll actually manage to eradicate all the pesky nations and germs we  hate so much, and then we'll be left with just ourselves to fight. I don't  believe for one second that those who commit and perpetuate these acts will be  satisfied until every opposing view is eradicated, but I do believe that diverse  perspectives are stronger than singular visions so I'm convinced that at some  point we who choose to seek harmony rather than unity will be the ones left  standing. But I'm sorry to hear Mattie's passed. Thanks for the update,  Julie.      &nbsp;    Much love     Peace        ----- Original Message -----       Sent:     Wednesday, June 23, 2004 4:10 PM      Subject:  [moonpyre] Mattie Stepanek    :-(                  Mattie    Stepanek, Poet and Advocate, Dies at 13           By STEPHEN    MANNING, AP            &nbsp;          ANNAPOLIS,    Md. (June 22) - Mattie Stepanek, the child poet whose inspirational verse made    him a best-selling writer and a prominent advocate for muscular dystrophy,    died Tuesday from complications of the disease. He was    13.            &nbsp;          Mattie died    at Children's  National   Medical   Center  in   Washington  , the hospital    said.            &nbsp;          'Mattie was    something special, something very special,' Muscular Dystrophy Association    National Chairman Jerry Lewis said in a statement. 'His example made people    want to reach for the best within themselves. It was easy to forget how sick    he was because his megawatt personality just made you want to    smile.            &nbsp;          Mattie had    dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy, a genetic disease that impaired almost    all of his body's major functions, such as heart rate, breathing, blood    pressure and digestion, and caused muscle    weakness.            &nbsp;&nbsp;             His mother,    Jeni, 44, has the adult-onset form of the disease, and his three older    siblings died of it in early childhood.            &nbsp;          Mattie began    writing poetry at age 3 to cope with the death of a brother. In 2001, a small      Virginia      publisher issued a slim volume of his poems, called 'Heartsongs.' Within    weeks, the book reached the top of The New York Times best-seller list, the    MDA said.            &nbsp;          He wrote    four other books: 'Journey Through Heartsongs,' 'Hope Through Heartsongs,'    'Celebrate Through Heartsongs' and 'Loving Through    Heartsongs.'            &nbsp;          Mattie's    poems brought him admirers including Oprah Winfrey and former President Carter    and made him one of the best-selling poets in recent    years.            &nbsp;          06/22/04    18:33 EDT             &nbsp;       http://www.oprah.com/spiritself/insp/psp/ss_insp_psp_mattie_tribute.jhtml                 \",\n",

Not that I'm sad to have a long weekend, but I have no plans to go anywhere or do anything, and most of my friends are on a choir trip to D.C., NY, and points between and around. As I was driving home from work last night, it dawned on me how alone I would be this weekend. Usually, I don't mind being by myself, but for some reason, I don't want to be alone this weekend. Yet here I am. I suppose it'll be time to catch up on my movies from Netflix. Speaking of....    I watched  Sunset Boulevard  last night for the first time (this was the short movie at 110 minutes -- the others are 179, 227, and 230 minutes, which should eat up some time). What an excellent movie all the way around. Story, acting, sets, lighting, costuming, all were excellent. And the story still stands viable today. It makes me want to investigate Billy Wilder more as a director, to possibly join my two favorites, Tim Burton and Ridley Scott (not to be confused with his brother, Tony Scott).    I wonder if I'll ever be an ever-was; I sure feel like a has-been right now, or, more correctly, a never-was. I don't want to be famous, and I don't think I deserve more than anyone else, but I want to have some sense of accomplishment in my life. I have an idea of something to come, but I can't see any path to it right now, if ever. It's not something I would have come up with on my own, but something I feel God calling me to. If it happens, it will definitely be all God and not me. I recently listened to a motivational speaker on PBS's quarterly membership drive programming, and she said that your life truly starts at 40. That would certainly be nice since I'm there now.    Otherwise, though, forty sucks.             \",\n",

I love the feeling of walking into a room full of people and completely taking control.  In this case it was a room full of bleary eyed, apathetic, hung-over, college freshmen at the end of another monotonous semester.  Apparently 'Art Appreciation' is short for 'Why the #@$%! do I have to be here today?!' Then I walk in, start my speil, and take complete control of the room.  I guess it helps that I actually care about what I'm talking about.  It's interesting how the speech started to adapt itself as I went along.  Basically I only had about a minutes worth of stuff written out in my mind, then I started to expand upon that based on the fascial expressions and reactions of the crowd.  I think it's important to involve the 'reader'/'viewer' in whatever it is your talking about, so I tend to adapt whatever I'm saying to a specific audience based on their response.  It's really interesting.  And it's something I've never really paid attention to till this event.  Anyways, the cool thing is I had about 8 people ask to sign up for my summer art classes, lets hope they do.  It'd be nice.   --Will                           \",\n",
       " \"                             August 22nd...     I had something that wiil be on my list of the most  memorable moment in my life... Or I can say... Moment when i feel the presence  and the plan He's been working on me...     It all start from Yesterday...      As usually I went to my church for the youth  fellowship every Saturday night at 7 p.m. That day I was told that today I'll  have to be on a meeting with all the rest of the committee in the church... I'll  have to represent the youth commitee since I'm the president. It's a regular  meeting held every three months. That time I said that I'll be on church  tomorrow which is today...     Now the story is getting nearer to the problem..       Later that night around 11 p.m. I received a sms  from a friend asking me to go to Carita beach with him the next day which is  today...     The problem is that I already promised to be on  church to follow the meeting..     That time I was faced with two options... It's  whether I keep my promise to be on the meeting or having fun with my friends  which is a rare thing.. Cause I don't spend much time going out with  him...     I must admit that time I was really fond of going to  the beach.. To be honest I never go there before.. Moreover, usually on the  meeting I only need about 15 minutes to report and the rest 2 hour will be used  on things that have nothing to do with my commitee...     So.. I start preparing the war tactics.. I called my  friend... I told him that I'll be going with him to Carita... I prepared my  report and decided to have my sister to give it indirectly to the person in  charge with the meeting...     I finally finished my report around 12 a.m.  midnight... Even I have to had this phone call from a girl I just knew... I  finished my report and I enjoyed the conversation... (Probably i'll put some  writings bout her)     And the plan worked really well... There was no  phone call or sms asking me to go to church.. But it seems that GOD has  different plan for me...     Suddenly my friend called me and said that we got  new company and this person is the sister of my other friend's girlfriend... GET  it??? Ok then.. Well the point is they can't say no to her.. And I have to give  my place... At this point I was really upset with my friend but I never want to  spend my time cryin' on my lowest mood... I always look on the brighter  side..     SEE.. This means that GOD wants me to do my duty and  wants me to be His servant.. Be at the meeting and do my president servant  job... I must admit that time something 'clicked' in my mind... I realize a  couple days ago I just made my promise to serve HIM more and do more to change  my bad attitude.. Well He placed me on the right track... See... If I still  persist to went to the beach probably my position as president will be  questioned... Even though I want to do my best to develop the youth fellowship  they will still questioned my commitment and this is not a good example for  those who's still in my committee team...      And I realize that moment I was making the report...  I really put all my thought and my concern on church.. I can't let others to do  this for me... This is my responsibility...      Well... Let's spend less time talking... ^__^ the  point is I believe GOD is preparing HIs plan for me.. and I shall follow HIs  path for I put my faith in HIM.. There's only one saviour for me, Jesus  Christ... Amen...              \",\n",

       " \"                             Disaster leads to Doubt   The inevitable happened - Marti's computer - after 2 years - has died. What started with massive issues with random reboots has turned into massive frustration and doubt in myself.   After backing everything up, I began the tedious task of reinstalling Marti's computer sans broadband, which has had it's Windows XP install since I gave her the computer as a Christmas+birthday present back in 2002 (the install was performed in mid-December 2001). Luckily, I backed everything up. Since then, 3 days ago, I have been unable to get an OS to install. Windows XP started randomly rebooting at any given point in the GUI part of the install, so I gave SuSE Linux 8.2 a whirl - and that crashed and burned just as much as XP. Unfortunately, the reboots are occuring so randomly, that I can't even get a fix on what could possibly be causing issues. Sometimes it's up for 30 seconds, sometimes as long as 10 minutes. So far, I've gone through every possible combination of 2 hard drives, 2 cdrom drives, 2 IDE cables, 2 video cards, countless copies of install media, 8 molex connectors, and have run the RAM through the the extensive Memory Test on the SuSE CD 3 times passing all 3 times (when the system doesn't reboot). I'm inclinded to say that it's either the motherboard, CPU, power supply, or the current coming from the wall.  I'm getting frustrated that I can't figure out what the problem is so much that I'm now doubting my abilities in troubleshooting. I know I shouldn't, but since money is so tight, I can't mis-judge the problem. I'll get over it I'm sure, and maybe it's just the frustration, but I should be able to figure this out - and I'm afraid I've exhausted all of my options here.  We're looking at buying a replacement motherboard and CPU from one of her dad's friends - it's used, but then again, if it fixes the problem, I don't much care at this point. We'll see how things go - I hope that by the end of this week she has her machine up and running with XP and SuSE 8.2 dual-booted. I'll end this rant here, since there's not much more to say.    Imports   Hardware, or electronics in general, cost SO much more in Hungary than the US. There's the 25% electronics tax, and then depending on the capabilities of the device, there might be more taxes on top of that. Tapes and CDs, for example, have a media tax on them to reimberse copyright holders for funds lost due to copying. With all of these taxes, it's no wonder why technology is, and will continue to be, slow in the adoption process. Take, for example, that the Apple Powerbook 17' costs 1,047,000Ft (US$5114) compared to it's $3000 pricetag in the US. Then you have to add the local sales tax on top of the huge mound of money!  The average Hungarian grosses US$500-US$750 a month. After taxes, bills and food, you can start to see the issue of where technology is expensive. Comparing the aforementioned Powerbook 17' to a  brand-new  Suzuki WagonR (a popular automobile in Hungary), which starts at 1,999,999Ft, and the laptop comes to half the price! Even taking into account that Apple's hardware generally costs more, most laptops (HP, Fujitsu-Siemens, and a few names I've never heard of) generally start at 500,000Ft and go up from there. Looking at media, even most new DVDs are upwards of 6,000Ft-8,000Ft (about US$30-US$40)! I'm sure a lot of this is true, especially in other Central and Eastern European countries, which I think is causing a slow adoption of technology, though I've not researched this, so don't quote me.                       \",\n",
       " \"                             Fragments for February 14 2004.    I'm trying out another  urlLink Fragment . If you don't know, it's where you take 3 random Fragment sentences and try to incorporate a story around them. The fragments are in bold.   'Wish I knew... how to  love  you.' he says, a saddened look upon his face.  'But it always seems like the harder I try the more I get hurt.'  The room that he's in is dark and gloomy, the only light coming from a tiny window at the top of the wall.  It illuminates his face as he grimaces in tortured pain.  'I don't know how many times I can be hurt  and keep coming back .'  A tormented and frustrated look inhabits his face, then suddenly we see why... 'I've  already  broken my arms, no telling what's next.  I don't know how much more I can take.'  Malcom sits pensively at the foot of the hospital bed.  His broken arms jutting precariously forward.  His whole torso and arms are cast in white plaster.  A tear starts to fall down his cheek, made even more sad by the fact that he has no mobile appendage with which to wipe it away.  'I only want to be loved.' he mourns aloud.    Suddenly a Nurse enters the room laden with latex and gauze.  She is large and unwieldy, her massive buttocks barely contained by her unforgiving white skirt.  She speaks in a loud screechy tone, 'Okeeay Mesta Malcom.  It's time for'sha 4 o'clock prickin'.'  An enormous needle makes it's way to Malcom's side.  The nurse with her delicate Dominatrixy ways man-handles Malcom's torso into strange and uncomfortable positions.  He screams out, unsure whether the pain is from the jabbing needle or her twisted malaise.  In the end it doesn't matter, because his heart is broken.  His tangled bones and bruised skin, can't match the pain of his blackened stony heart.  It has died, and he will never love again.  'So bring on the pain...' He thinks to himself.  Suddenly the pain is brought as Nurse bends him back into place.  He screams out even louder than before.  She looks at him scornfully, as though she can't stand his pathetic cries.  ' If you think they're  goin'ta get bedda wit'out any pen, you're in faw sum real trouble Meesta Malcom.'  He returns the scornful look, knowing full well she could never know his pain, for she has never lost as much as he has.   When you don't get  to be with the one you love, no pain can match that torture.  He smiles slightly at Nurse as she leaves the room.  For he knows something that she will never know.  He knows that there is someone so special that she could make all of his pain go away.  If only he knew how to love her.  He returns to his pensive pondering.  Counting the bricks in the wall and mumbling to himself.  '...Wish I knew how to try.  Wish I knew.. how to love you.'   --Will                 \",\n",
       " \"                             Getting something off my chest.   So I just finished lifting weights.  This is the middle of week three.  I feel really good about my workouts. I can definitely tell that something is working.   I'm actually starting to see definition in my arms even when I'm NOT flexing.  That's awesome.  I haven't had that in a really long time.  Unfortunately it seems that I've gained 4 pounds since my last weigh-in on Saturday.  I guess I've been sneaking in too many snacks in between meals.  Oh well, I've got till Saturday to get it back off.  I know I was feeling a little depressed about the slow progress, and that led to me breaking down a couple times.  Nothing major, it was like 2 granola bars and an extra bowl of cereal during the week.  I've done much worst in the past.  I look at this experience though, not as a diet, but as changing my life.  I eat healthy about 90% of the time and the other 10 % I'm just trying to keep the damage to a minimum.  Like eating granola bars instead of chocolate bars.  And drinking Sprite instead of DrPepper.  But eventually I hope to cut even that amount down.    Even though I've been on a new eating plan for 3 months and a new workout plan for less than a month, I still feel like I'm only now getting started with all of this.  Somewhere around month 3 I plan to be lifting twice as much weight and running/walking, biking or swimming 5-6 days every week.  It kind of feeds into itself.  The more swimming I do, and the more weight lifting I do, the more I WANT to do.  It's like an addiction.  But once I get to that point where I'm going full throttle, the weight will start coming off a whole lot faster and I can relax a little with my eating.  I think that's why 'Diets' seem to ALWAYS fail, it's because you're fighting your natural instincts.  Everyone has the ability to eat whatever they want, I don't think it has anything to do with Metabolism.  It's just that so many people remain stationary and don't exercise.  Or don't exercise enough for the amount that they eat.  I'm sure I have a long way to go though on this whole journey.  I've always known that it wouldn't be that hard once I figured it out... once I figured myself out.  I had to really look into myself, and record everything that I did for several months and break down 'what I did' and 'why I did it'.  I discovered tons of conditions that caused me to overeat and binge and remain depressed and remain sedentary.  I discovered that I was eating unconsciously.  I often would eat a healthy meal and not feel satisfied because it didn't come from the store.  So I would have to walk to the 7-11 and buy a fried pie and a coke.  Then I'd eat it and get high.  In fact it almost all came down to me wanting to get high... on food.  Sometimes it was to keep me from thinking, sometimes it was to escape but most of the time it was just out of habit.  I can't count how many times I would go buy some junk and shoot up my veins with fruit filling then drive around high for a couple hours.    It makes me wonder what everyone else's life is like.  If someone were to sit down and just write down everything that they did that day and try to figure out why they did it.  I wonder if it turned out they had some sort of psychological dilemma of their own?  Anyways... I gotta go to bed.  I'm going swimming early tomorrow.   --Will     \",\n",

In the last month - since mid-December - not only have I read 1 book, but many. To date, I have now read: -  1984  by George Orwells -  Memoirs of a Geisha  by Arthur Golden - a collection of short stories by Rob Murray (everything besides the short book) -  Soul of the Fire  - Book 5 of the  Sword of Truth  series - by Terry Goodkind  and I'm currently 200 pages, after 24 hours, through  Faith of the Fallen  - Book 6 of the  Sword of Truth  series - by Terry Goodkind. Next I have  Pillars of Creation , again by Terry Goodkind, then Rob's book (sorry d00d - want to catch up on the series), and by then I hope to have found an English copy of  Naked Empire , Book 8, and  Debt of Bones , which precludes the series 40 years. Book 9 is slated for a January 2005 release, so I've got some time to catch up elsewhere. After that, I haven't a clue - I think Marti has all o f the Harry Potter books in English. Maybe I'll snag through those too.  I'll throw my thoughts around on the books later. It's getting late and it's time to crash.                       \",\n",

I was in ninth grade (1978-79 school year), in the GT program. Somehow, we got a TRS-80 in our weekly class, and I was instantly fascinated. I couldn't play sports, and I wasn't that good in band (even though I enjoyed it thoroughly). But here was something that I could actually make happen. And no one teased me in the process. When my very existence incited ridicule and derision from my peers (and the teachers allowed it in class), it was kind of nice to be able to do something without being judged for it. (imagine my frustration with Micro$oft Word trying to tell me what I want to do...)    And I've been pretty decent at it ever since then. Not great, but better than average. Kind of sad that the machines are easier to relate to than so many people. I'm glad that the people I'm around now aren't like junior high kids (though I've seen some that have never grown up). Check out  urlLink Why Nerds are Unpopular  for more thoughts on this whole phenomenon. The article is lengthy, but I pretty much support everything in it. There ya go.             \",\n",

       " \"                             Imperial/English vs. Metric   While reading through  urlLink Slashdot  today, I came across the article   urlLink Another English/Metric 'Spacecraft' Problem  , which talks about a recent incident at  urlLink Tokyo Disneyland's   urlLink Space Mountain . While the article is somewhat interesting, the comments following the story were more interesting, as it started turning into a debate of English/Imperial Measurement versus Metric Measurement. One comment followed like this:    Anonymous Coward @  urlLink 16:32 2004-01-26 : ...No system of measure is inherently better or worse than another....   urlLink Carnivore (103106)  @  urlLink 17:36 2004-01-26  I disagree. You can truthfully say that no system is any more accurate than another, but since people have to work with the system and convert from unit to unit, some systems are inherently better.  Let's take an example from last night's Mythbusters episode: The rowing 8 that Stanford used for the demonstration has a mass of ~ 1000 kg when loaded with crew. If you were to design one, what volume water would you have to displace to float the boat? Since water is ~ 1 kg/l, we have 1000l, which is the same as 1 m^3.  The process is much more complicated in the imperial system. We have ~2200 lbs.Water weighs ~8 lbs/gal, so that's 265 gallons of water. According to units, that's 35.42 cubic feet, which is, of course, pretty much the same as 1 cubic meter.  The difference here is that it took me 5 minutes and 2 different programs (calculator and units) to do it in the imperial system.    In all honesty, I can say that I don't remember learning extremely in-depth conversions in the metric system, such as the aforementioned ~1kg/L, but if Metric truly is that simple, then why hasn't the United States come to terms and simply just accept the single measurement system? Would it not be easier to remember that: 1 Liter = 10 deciliters = 100 centiliters = 1,000 milliliters  rather than: 1 Gallon = 4 quarts = 8 pints = 16 cups  and then have to worry when you're not dealing with whole units? What, if anything, is wrong with base10, since the rest of the world seems to have adopted it? After living in the metric world for a bit, where I couldn't fathom ever adjusting to the measurement system, I'm slowly getting there without even trying. I'd say the hardest measurements to adjust to are distance and weight.   Think of it this way. In your head try to figure the answers out: 1. How many mi is 15,000yd? 2. How many km is 15,000m?  Answers: 1. 8.52272727... Mi (used Palm Calc) 2. 15km (used my head)  For me, this raises the question: Why does the US hold on to it's full use of English/(modified) Imperial measurement? Sure, the UK hasn't completely gone Metric (yet), as it's holding dearly to its fluid measurements, but it's switched almost entirely otherwise?                       \",\n",

Anyway, as a fairly big supporter of Coppola Wines myself, I think it's a capital idea. They generally put out a good product so why should this be any different?        This is great for those occasions where you just want to do a little toasting without having to consume a whole bottle of Champagne...or try to save the rest for later...which is a pain because the corks never go back in...then you have to hunt around for that metal champagne bottle re-corker you used to have in the back of the drawer...and even if you do find it, those big champagne bottles never fit in you refridgerator properly...so, what the hell, you may just as well drink the rest yourself...except, shit, you did and now you remember that drinking too much champagne causes your acid reflux to act up...but even so you couldn't see wasting the rest of this expensive bubbly...but, whatever, waking up in the middle of the night rooting around for your Zantac is no damn fun.

       " \"                             Laptop Surgery   Well, today was definitely fun and exciting. Marti's friend Gabi (Gabriella) came over today, bringing her  sick  laptop with her. I don't want to know HOW, but somehow she managed to fubar the floppy drive. And with the new drive in hand, in that typical Compaq shipping box, and her Compaq Presario 700 in the other, she brought the patient to the surgery table.  Let me start by saying I highly DISLIKE Compaq laptops. The same holds true for Hewlett-Packard laptops, since they are now the same. They do have their purpose - they fill in the 'cheap but good' market - if you take care of them, they will last. If not, well, you get what happened to Gabi's - something fubar. It has to do with their construction, being that though they are heavyweights, coming in over 6 lbs, they still feel like they'd break if I blew on it. It just does not have that sturdy feel that I generally find in the laptops I look for. (see below)  So I took the poor little (ehrm.. not so little, with it's 15' display and 6.39lb weight) bugger to the table, filled with 2 desklamps, an assortment of screwdrivers, paper and pen for notes and screw maps, my camera, and began the work. The Compaq Presario 700 is rather simple to dismantle, once you know where you're going. Most of the screws are of the T8 torque variety; you will find 2 or 3 that use an uber-small philips head. Getting to the floppy drive requires that you practically dismantle the entire laptop - all under screws, including those under the battery, the display front panel, the keyboard, and underlying metal 'plate', then the plastic top housing the touchpad/wrist rests, etc all must be removed. After 1 hour of careful dismantling, picture taking, documenting, screwmapping, I removed the ONE FREAKIN' SCREW holding the floppy drive in place to swap it out with the new one! I would've thought, with all that went in to securing the rest of the laptop together, the manufacturer would've at least secured the floppy drive a little more - but no - one screw. It's not like the drive caddy even snaps into place. It's simply suspended there with one screw.   Afterwards, putting the laptop back together was a breeze with everything properly mapped and such. No orphaned screws! And everything works! doubleplusgood! One always gets a little nervous about doing such things to laptops, especially those that are not your own, but the overall joy of every successful surgery is promptly granted at the first sign of things booting up and even more so when, after testing, every key, every aspect of the device works properly. Gabi seems more than happy to have a fully working laptop again, which is cool. I always like doing this kinda stuff, so for me, it's just more that I can chalk up to experience.  Since this is the first time I've actually had a camera with me, I'll be doing a full write-up with pictures and everything(!) about dismantling the Presario 700. I'll actually have some real content for the web to read! YAY! :cheer: Now - to find a place to host it.... :waits for someone to offer some space and bandwidth for a little ol' geek with no money: :vbfeg:  Above, I mentioned my dislike of Compaq/HP laptops. So I might as well define now what I like in a laptop. I'm not much into the whole American idea of 'bigger is better' (at least for laptops). Honestly, my current 13' display is too much. I've taken a liking to what has been coined as ultra-portable or sub-notebooks. Smaller displays, smaller keyboards, yes. But the benefits are amazing. Some of these notebooks offer a DVD+-RW and are still under 3lbs! Battery lives are a key thing manufacturers look at. A Sony PCG-TR2 with the extended battery has been known to show well over 7 hours of continuous use; closer to 10 hours with every power-saving measure taken! So I like small-footprint, lightweight laptops.   For an example, check out the  urlLink review  of the Sony PCG-TR1A by  gr00vy0ne  over at his site,  urlLink siliconpopculture.com   While my Dell Latitude CPi-A400XT has survived a very abused life, travelingg around the US, to Frankfurt's airport a few times, and now to Hungary 4 times and suffering an accidental 5Ft (1.6m) fall onto a hard tile floor at the airport, it still functions to this day, albeit not as well as when purchased 3+ years ago. But times they are a changing, and while this thing still runs, it's suffering display issues (no more soft boots :frown: ), has suffered a hard drive failure in the past, and the CPU power just isn't there for me. So, as a replacement, I'm looking into:  -  urlLink Sony   urlLink Vaio   urlLink PCG-TR2  -  urlLink Panasonic   urlLink W-series Toughbook  -  urlLink Apple   urlLink 12' Powerbook   In non-geek news, it's still butt cold here - I think last night it hit below -10 C. I know that's not like 0 F, but it just feels DAMNED cold.  I learned a little bit more Hungarian today. Lessons are painfully slow to learn, such as remembering to say  vagy  instead of  vagyok  when referring to someone else instead of yourself.  Keep an eye out in the next few days for the article on the Compaq to show up (hopefully). I'll keep everyone posted, and maybe, if I figure out how to do images and such in this blog (I think I need my own host for those too),  I'll post some of the more 'gruesome' shots :grin:                       \",\n",
       " \"                             Last night, I watched  The Winslow Boy . It's a very good movie primarily about the relationship between a man in post-Victorian England and his three children, two boys and a girl. The youngest, 13-14 year old Ronnie, gets into trouble at the military school he attends and is expelled. He maintains his innocence throughout, and the whole family sacrifices to fight to prove his innocence in light of the seemingly incontrovertible evidence against him. The trials or hearings are essentially off-camera the entire movie and serve as the unifying force for the family, even the oldest brother, Dickie (the second movie in the past week with a character named 'Dickie'; hmmm), giving up his position at Oxford. This movie is very character-driven, typical of virtually all of Mamet's works; if you're looking for action, take a Valium and the movie will seem very fast. [This should not be construed as an endorsement of the illicit use of drugs, or the use of illicit drugs.] I highly recommend this movie.

Let's see... last leap year I was 23... hmmm... 2000... nope.... I had my head up my ass then.  You know, I was thinking the other day (you believe that?) and I realized that it was a year ago this month, that I committed to getting in shape and losing weight.  A year, do you believe that?  And it took me almost 9 months to get the ball rolling.  And almost the full year to get where I was competent at managing my life.  That's pretty ridiculous.  Anyways, I made 3 very important realizations this week.  One, I'm not doing enough cardiovascular exercise.  Two, I don't need to be doing weight lifting till I make more head way on losing weight.  And three, I'm STILL eating way too many carbohydrates.  Last week I started doing 20 minutes on the exercise bike (and I have the hurting ass to prove it!) before swimming each day.  That has made a HUGE difference in my weight control.  Apparently, even though I'm getting better at swimming.  To the point where I swim at least 30 - 40 laps each time without hardly stopping to catch my breath.  I am still not to the endurance where it helps me to lose weight.  I think in another month or two it will be.  But it's not right now.  I've also cut back on weight lifting because it doesn't seem to be helping my cause right now.  I've got some pretty big muscles, but you can barely see them.  So I figure in another month or two, as I'm getting to lose more weight from swimming and bicycling, I'll jump back into weight lifting full swing.  My muscles aren't the problem, it's my lungs and my metabolism.  Lastly, I've realized that I've been sneaking all kinds of breads into my diet more and more.  Lots of crackers here and there, and too much rice with each meal and at least 2 or 3 bowls of cereal before bed (which is the worst time for it).  This weekend I've started cooking just chicken and stirfry vegetables (no rice or breads) before dinner, and I've lost 5 pounds this weekend alone.    So that's  that .  Lets hope that next leap year I'm a millionaire, or at least immensely successful with my writing and art.  And I especially hope that I am finally in shape.  I don't want to be 30 and still looking like a pear.   --Will                               \",\n",

The entire animation has almost no dialogue.  I mean, there are some characters speaking in french, but for the most part you don't need any verbal cues to understand the story.  It's brilliantly done, with symbolism and repetition of themes.  It also had some of the best characterization I've seen in a cartoon in a long time.  The Grandmothers personality was brilliantly drawn.  She and the Dog are probably the best part of the movie.  I love how there are 2 or 3 themes throughout the story that are constantly repeated and tied back in.  There is one theme with trains, of which the main characters dog is deathly afraid of.  It starts with him as a puppy, He's tired of chasing the boys toy train around the track and he sits down with his little tail sitting on the toy railroad track and the little train runs it over.  And they never let it go from there.  The entire movie, whenever there's a train the dog is barking at it, and it sets up some hilarious scenes.  My favorite scene is when the dog is asleep he's 'dreaming' about trains.  Suddenly he's on the train barking at the window in his home as the train passes.  It's the opposite of how the scene plays in his real world, but it's done in a very funny way.   I think the best part of the movie is how they take the inherrent iconography and exageration that makes cartoons so magical (ala, bugs bunny, etc...) and they carry these over into a somewhat more realistic style.  The french Mafia goons are these very blocky characters, and the Mafia bosses are almost 'Just' a head.  And the bicyclists (which are sort of the central characters) are almost stick-figure characters with tremendous exageration of the muscles.  It was incredible how far they were able to go with everything.  And anything can happen.  You're constantly reminded that cartoon characters don't abide by normal laws and they have a lot of fun with breaking those laws.  And I loved the personalities of the Triplettes.  Anyways, I highly recommend this movie to anyone that gets the chance to see it.  Unfortunately if you're in Lubbock it's too late to see it in theaters.  It was only here this week.  I hate this town.     --Will                   \",\n",

I'm guilty of it myself.  It's refreshing to get away from that and into something more established.  I think I can learn a lot from them.  And not just with the drawing part of the career.

       " \"                             Making markets work for poor- Rural Credit- India                           By: - Sunil Porwal, Vinita Porwal, and J.P.Rai.  Poor in India suffer primarily because of lack of bargaining power in the markets where they participate. This lack of bargaining power is similar to what the rich used to face for cement, telephone, cars etc during days of License Raj.  Since late 80’s for various reasons we started de-regulating various markets, which essentially gave options to the consumers. This bargaining power to the consumer is the key to whatever improvement one sees in markets, which have been deregulated completely, or partially in India. E.g. Cement, steel, organized finance, housing finance, automobiles, telephones, etc.  Transferring this bargaining power has helped only the rich because, unfortunately, the socialist mind set allowed us to experiment only with rich men’s markets, as it was always thought that poor can’t survive in “markets.” So the benefit of this transferring of bargaining power mostly reached the rich, as most of the deregulated markets happened to be the affluent/ “rich men’s” markets. Poor men markets were never touched as it was presumed that the markets exploit the poor. The notion or mindset is that markets are bad and poor can’t enter markets. (Without realizing that he is already there in health, credit, water, energy etc markets).  We beg to differ on the assertion that poor can’t enter markets as he is illiterate and is not capable of bargaining. This tantamount to saying that poor are not intelligent. First and foremost is that poor have been entering various markets but he doesn’t enjoy them because shortages don’t allow him to bargain. We will like to say that given the options to choose from, poor too have capacity to bargain and take benefit from the markets. There are numerous examples to show that given the choice poor can intelligently decide. But if there are no choices then even educated and rich can’t bargain. You can’t bargain when there are shortages. Today the poor are unable to derive benefit of the markets not because he is poor, or illiterate etc but because most of the markets he goes to are full of shortages. How can one bargain in market, which is full of shortages? Were the rich capable of bargaining when there used to be shortage of cement during license raj in India? It is well known that in shortages not only prices go up but even bad quality is accepted.  Process of deregulation takes out this shortage from the markets. In the last 15 years have we ever heard of cement shortage? But till today we keep hearing of electricity shortage, water shortage, inadequate health services, non-availability of cheap credit etc.  We can help the poor in a short time if we can identify reasons for these shortages and remove them.  To elaborate on this we take the case of informal credit markets in India.  A Few facts about the money market  a)      Interest rates in unorganized markets have not fallen and spread between organized and unorganized market remains very high indicating shortage of supply in the latter.            b)      The micro-credit market is huge and coverage by government / donor /multilateral agencies supported vehicles is dismally low. Further the efficiency of the delivery system is not up to standard threatening the very sustainability of such efforts.       c) As per World Bank report and many other studies it is seen that the risk of informal lenders are low because people don’t want to lose their lender of last resort. Why moneylenders are exploitative?  The vast market and high interest rate in informal markets should make it very attractive for potential investor or other business people to become moneylenders. But then why this is not happening?  “THE village moneylender in Bangladesh charges interest rates of over 150 percent a year. Citibank would love to get that kind of return on its investments -- so why isn't Citibank lending money in Bangladesh villages?” Source :-(In a model for lending in developing nations, a Bangladesh bank relies on peer          pressure for collateral. New York Times; New York, N.Y.; Nov 22, 2001;  urlLink Hal R. Varian ). Our comment: -- why more moneylenders not entering this lucrative market and giving competition to existing lenders? The words most commonly associated with the traditional moneylender are “greedy”, “unscrupulous” and “usurious”. Since independence, and even before that, innumerable laws were enacted to wipe out this “scourge” from rural India. Mindset is that money lending is bad, blood sucking etc. all literature on the subject worldwide talks about ills of money lending.  In view of this various government world over have tried replacing them with various govt. supported credit program like RRBs, NGOs, Co-operative banks, credit societies, SHG’S etc. However, Govt supported efforts (top down approach) suffered from various problems associated with bureaucracy and have not succeeded in tackling the problem in any measure.         As compared to this the informal lenders have advantages of being reachable and sustainable with high efficiency.  In view of above facts the ground reality remains that the moneylender survives and enjoys the market as entry of people i.e. their own class who could have given right competition to them; was always condemned and the machinery proposed to meet the demand never functioned.  We have already seen above, the successful deregulation of some of the rich men’s markets. The sectors that have done well are those that have been opened up to competition, and where the laws of demand and supply have been allowed to operate and people have been given the choice.  Why would not the same work for rural credit? By hounding the moneylender, are we not creating an artificial scarcity? If we accept that moneylenders continue to have a role to play, would not the rural poor be better served by allowing more such moneylenders to operate? Increased supply of moneylenders as a source of credit would ensure more competition, which would translate into better terms for rural credit.  The policies that have been adopted till date have had the dual effect of limiting supply, and increasing the risk profile. At the same time, these policies have failed to eradicate the moneylender as a source of rural credit. Alternatives in the form of institutional credit have also failed - else, why would the moneylender still be around? So, the resultant effect has been to push the rural poor to moneylenders who are operating as near-monopolies in their respective areas with high interest rates.  Since we have tried all these things for other sectors, it is worth having a new look at our approach to the traditional moneylender. If he is going to be around (and his resilience so far gives no reason to assume otherwise), would not the cause of the rural credit be better served by co-opting him into the system, and subjecting him to the laws of demand and supply?  We can name them as “rural non banking finance companies “ or money traders.  The views express here are personal views of the authors.     \",\n",
       " '                             Mechanics of transferring power to poor                                                  By: - Sunil Porwal                                                           While we adopted a free political model but the mechanics evolved for economic and social progress over year’s strangulated people’s freedom, their capacities to think and make their decisions, as they were not given options to do so. Over the years we have experimented with statutes after statutes, laws after laws, rules after rules, regulations and regulators after regulations and regulators, schemes after schemes, plans after plans but still major section of the country is where it was. Helpless, health less, money less, waterless, education less etc. Rather some sections have been suffering constant slide in competitive terms.  Though tolerance of Indian society is a great strength but we shouldn’t be so complacent about anything. Let us not test the patience of the have not’s too much. We have to act and we have to act positively to empower them. The only way is to transfer excessive power enjoyed by public servants to poor. But how?  The way out is to create parallels/alternates to government interventions and increase competition in sectors wherever possible by providing choices to people. Choices make people to think and apply mind and decide. That application of mind is a journey towards truth and empowerment.  Element of subsidy can be build in the system where ever and for whomever it may be required for social and economic considerations.  Only choices to people will put desirable pressure on existing players and will break monopolies or oligopolies. In whatever sector it is, let it be water, education, health, electricity, rural credit, agriculture markets, agriculture processing etc.  People argue that how choices will be helpful if people don’t have purchasing power. To understand it we need to review evolution of Indian economy for last 50 years.   Though one can almost see a direct co-relation between purchasing power and bargaining power but is it always true? There can be situations when your desires and your purchasing power are of no use and you can’t bargain, as you have no options. Think of cement, telephone, car industry etc in India in let say 1980 and today. Though many of us had sufficient purchasing power but we commanded no or very little bargaining power in these markets in 1980. We were at the mercy of one or few supplier’s thanks to rules/policies/ mind set etc. A careful examination of these three markets in 1980 show: -  a)     Short supply of both goods and the agencies supplying the goods. b)     Government control on production and supply. c)      Queues and queues. And babu’s employed to regulate used their monopolistic power in most discretionary fashion. d)     Bad quality at cost plus rates were the outcome.  The late 80s’ saw the deregulation of cement sector, followed by the Cars and Telecom sectors’ liberalization along with many others. The results are visible:  a)     More choices to people. They can select. No shortage, no lines, no permits, no minister’s recommendation for telephone, etc.  b)     Better quality and more variety at competitive rates.   The main reasons for this empowerment are transfer of power acquired since independence by public servants back to the concerned people and not the increase in purchasing power. The mechanics of doing was to open supply channels to more participants making them to enter the market and compete. This process was not a simple privatization. Here we consciously opened supply lines to allow anyone having the wherewithal to enter the market and compete. This was done at no cost to government. The result is fast and widespread. No one had to run after its implementation, as the market creates enough pressure to make the stakeholders work. The imperfections in these markets were removed as the causative factors were dismantled and power was transferred to people. The change is helpful to all the stakeholders, i.e. consumers, suppliers, government etc and hence has not remained like a pilot project, and there is a sustainable change.  In these three sectors and many other sectors liberalized instead of a babu sitting in palatial secretariat taking decisions, now it’s the suppliers and buyers who are taking decisions. The power is transferred to the real stakeholders to take decisions and hence their empowerment.  Power sector vs. telecom sector reform - Reform process in Power vis-à-vis the Telecom sector in India since the early 1990s reveals that in power sector we followed two courses. First, the MOU route to set up generation capacity and second, the unbundling of state electricity boards. Both changes only created controversies and derailment of reform process in the critical power sector. Result- No Change. In telecom sector we followed the approach of providing choices to people and it has worked. Choices to consumers in power sector are not an unknown thing.   Poor men markets - The markets can be broadly divided in two segments. i.e. markets frequented by rich, eg. Car, housing loan, telephone, television etc. and second category is the market frequented by everyone irrespective of their income. Eg. Money market, education, health, water, electricity, agriculture, labor etc.  While we deregulated many of the markets frequented by rich but we shirk away from doing so when it came to poor men markets. Our socialist mind set didn’t allow us to touch poor men markets as it was always thought that poor can’t survive in “markets” and therefore can’t be exposed to the markets. (Without realizing that he is already there in many markets like, agriculture, health, credit, water, energy etc and is getting exploited due to imperfections in these markets).  Thus poor men have been deprived of benefits of bargaining power, which have accrued to rich men because of liberalization in their markets. If we follow same course in many of the poor men markets then we will see history repeating itself.  A look at various markets frequented by poor regularly i.e. agriculture markets, credit markets, health, water, education, electricity, etc one will find following features. : -  a)     Perpetual shortages of supplies and/or suppliers/ buyers etc   b)     Excessive public servants control, c)      Lack of choices and competition, d)     Bad quality of services at higher cost typical of shortage in a market.  The imperfection in these markets is due to ill-conceived policies and norms and excessive control. Dismantling these barriers can increase the bargaining power of poor at a much faster pace as has happened in cases mentioned above.   Agriculture markets: - Accrual of higher incomes to farmers in sustainable manner is the main concern of all. The way out is either to reduce input cost or/and increases productivity or/ and increased price realization.  Price realization of output can be increased by higher value addition or higher margins to growers. High tax regimes (excise, sales tax, and taxes on packaging material) is a barrier to the growth of processed food industry while monopolistic regulated markets all over India deny growers of wider options to sell their produce.  Reducing taxes on processed food and allowing parallels to the present regulated agriculture markets can go a long way in increasing growers’ incomes, which will in turn push capital formation and innovations in agriculture.  Though these have been recognized as critical constraints but we are still procrastinating over their implementation. Result public servant remains overpowered at the cost of underpowered poor. E.g. Amendment to Agriculture Markets Act of various states is languishing with the GOI, which is working on a model act from the last two years, but still we are where we were.  Actually what we need is legal space for players to operate parallely to APMCs. This can be achieved by simple notification under the saving clause of concerned Act. State of Maharashtra adopted similar route for its cotton monopoly scheme in 2002 successfully. Instead of going around amending the legislation the monopoly was broken by allowing other players to enter the market by notification under the saving clause of the Act.  Education markets: - India’s expenditure on education is relatively much better but commensurate outcomes still defy us. Quality is a major concern. There are no choices to people for free schooling other than government sponsored/ controlled schools. Hence power vests with the public servant and not with the poor who has no choices, no options to choose from.  Providing education voucher to poor can provide space to him to bargain and choice system will come into operation. This can be done by ear marking some funds to start with for this system. It can bring features of market into fully government-sponsored sector.  Vouchers can be issued by concerned district education officer and distributed by the collector of concerned district on the basis of prescribed norms. Schools getting vouchers, as fee will surrender same to concerned district education officer for payments.  The only malpractice can be over estimation of eligible people and sale of vouchers. Though we shouldn’t be so much concern about genuine sale of vouchers by some poor under distress but monitoring of false issue of vouchers may be needed.  Health markets: - 87% of health expenditure in India is out of pocket expenditure. Hence complaint of under involvement of public sector in health and the same cited as main cause for poor health indices.  In education expenditures in India are at par with many countries but still our levels are much lower. So just mere higher expenditure is not sufficient to improve a sector. Neither over regulation.  The key element in health sector is qualified doctors. Health sector revolve around doctors, on whose advice everyone takes treatment. India ranks quite low when it comes to number of doctors per 1000 people in the country. In India it is 0.4 as compare to 1 and 1.5 for low-income countries and world average respectively.   Let us imagine what would have been health scenario in India if we had 1 million doctors instead of present 0.5 million. If one studies the core health indicators and availability of doctors in comparative countries one notices that the number of doctors plays a significant role in health care as shown by the indicators. In India we have always been very negative in sanctioning medical colleges. Limited private medical colleges exploit students in terms of fees, engage public servant in rounds of unproductive regulations, court cases and thirdly low supply of qualified doctors.  There is a need to rethink on policy for regulating grant of medical colleges on urgent basis else prospective health tourism and health insurance in the country will divert professionals further from non lucrative markets to lucrative markets affecting poor further.  Government should only control quality through medical council instead of controlling number. Rather there is a strong case for government to support facilities, which increases supply of doctors.  Presently most of the expenditure in health sector in India is in private sector. There is a strong demand to increase public expenditure in health care sector. I think it will be better that the increased expenditure on health sector can be used for giving health vouchers to people. While increase in doctors on one hand will increase dispersion giving higher bargaining power to poor, the vouchers can further add to their bargaining power.   Water markets: - While in metros we get water for about Rs.300/- month per family including water bill, pumping and storage cost etc., in hinterland people land up paying much more for water. Large number of people in rural areas has to sacrifice whole day’s labor to fetch water on regular basis. The lost of opportunity by poor in such cases makes them pay actually much more for water.  Again the sector suffers from no choices and monopolistic state control. Over powered public servant dominates. Two-pronged strategy is needed in the sector. First recognize rights of people on water, which will provide incentive for private investment in creation and maintenance of water resources. And secondly incremental government expenditure to be incurred through voucher route to deepen markets.   System of issue, distribution and payment for voucher etc can be same as that in case of education sector.    Electricity markets: - Every family in India (even poorest of families) spends every day some money or the other for fulfilling their electricity needs. It may be in the form of candles, lantern, petromax, inverters, and generators etc. In one has to spend money to run and maintain many of these devices. The farmers also spend money for running diesel engines etc. Thus many people are capable of paying their electricity bills. Many studies have proved this. Though it may not fully match the cost of power that many sections may use once provided to them.  I have already discussed how we have approached this sector since early 90s’. The sector continues to be plagued by shortages and poor service. Reason is not too far to seek. Monopolistic state control of electricity persists till today. There is no choice and competition in the sector.  The right course for electricity sector is to create parallels of electricity boards in generation; transmission and distribution by mechanics of open access through stand alone entities or integrated entities. The only thing is that these parallels to electricity boards should be in the private sector.  In addition, if the State feels the necessity to give subsidy to deserving people, it can be done by way of vouchers so that market is not distorted and imperfections don’t occur.  Rural credit: - Poor borrow more than others. Many of them borrow from moneylenders for various reasons. Efforts made by government from time to time have failed to provide credit to poor. The supply channels have remained clogged causing shortages and situations for exploitation by moneylenders.  High rate of interest by moneylenders is an indication of short supply in the market. Thus no choices and competition resulting in exploitative interest rates.  Traders are present and trade in many items and commodities in rural area, so why not money traders? If we can allow private bankers then why not money traders, who are only allowed to lend. Century old taboo against moneylenders always forces us to react negatively to this class of people. As we talk of creating business environment for various businesses then why not we do the same for money traders so that supply of such traders increase leading to competition causing interest rates to fall. The way to provide this kind of environment, which enthuses new players to enter, is not to hound moneylenders but to recognize them.  This will provide more choices to poor to borrow and hence more bargaining power.  We can call them money traders or “rural non – banking finance companies” which will be allowed to only give credit. They will be required to apply for license to district collector and acknowledgement of application will be permanent license. No other regulation to hound them.  In all the above cases suggestions are to adopt approaches with following common denominator:  1)     More choices to people to increase the bargaining power then enjoyed by them presently. This will happen because of dismantling of certain rules/regulations/policies/norms etc.  Now decisions will come from bottom instead of top. It will be truly people’s decision and empowered decision. 2)     Secondly the subsidies through voucher system will provide scope for widening and deepening the markets and choice mechanism thus helping and empowering poor.

Plopping everything into place, I've gotten almost everything, hardware wise, back to normal. I need to find the manual to get the pin-out of the front USB port header, otherwise, all is well.

       " \"                             San Diego Comic-Con - Day ONE       So this is just a disclaimer. The next 4 or 5 posts may be a little boring. They're mostly my journal from the convention, lots of business observation and industry babble. So forgive the mundane nature for the next few days. But who knows.. maybe you're into that sort of thing.      WEDNESDAY     My tradition for going to San Diego is to drive. It's a bit of insanity mixed with the love of the road. It's a 24 hour drive from Lubbock to San Diego. But if timed well you can hit some gorgeous countryside, and get to the coast in time to check into the Hotel and Convention early and have time to just relax about. Our timing was off by about 3 hours early this time around. That is, for everything except pulling up to the sound of waves crashing on the cliffs at 6 am in an misty magical overcast morning. That made the entire trip... to that point and any point after... completely worth while to me. In fact, the last year finally felt worth while after 10 minutes of sitting on this cliffside. It's funny the things you crave after living in a desert for so long.     Anyways, we were way early for everything the rest of the day. Too early to get badges, too early to get a room, we were even too early to go to the outdoor mall. Everything was closed. But whatever. Better early than late. So it was dragass-wednesday, the entire first half of the day. In the evening, Adrienne crashed out, she hadn't had any sleep at all, not even in the car for some reason. So I took Jay to preview night at the Comic-Con. We walked around the convention floor and I showed him where everything, and everyone was. It turned out better this way I think, so he wasn't completely overwhelmed going at it alone when this monster show finally opened on Thursday. We got lots of free stuff, talked to some of the  urlLink Shane Glines Artist  group from LA and wrapped the evening with chatting a little with Mike Mignola and getting sketches in his Convention exclusive Hellboy sketchbook.     afterwards Jay and I drove up to Encinidas to check out the  urlLink Jeff Watts Atelier . It's an art school designed after the old masters way of teaching art. I've been wanting to check this place out for the last couple years, actually... ever since my first Comic-Con in '97. I don't know what it was. Maybe San Diego tempting me, or me wanting to be tempted. But there was something magical about being there. The school's tucked away in a small center at the top of a steep hill in this California mountain. The mist was still prominent and all around as we leaned against the car in front of the school talking. The doors to the building were open and light streamed out carrying the echoes of teaching voices from within. I walked into the front office to admire the incredible framed sketches adorning the walls. Listening to the instruction from down the hall. One of the outer classrooms was also open and I peeked in to see the dozen or so students enthralled in the night's lesson. I soaked in the atmosphere for a good 20-30 minutes before we finally sloaked away, back down the mountain.     It was a good first day. Very low stress, very comforting. A complete contrast to the madness of last years show. And it pretty much stayed that way the entire trip.          --Will                                             \",\n",
       " \"                             Sinking in.   I haven't had a great week.  Lots of forces working against each other in my life right now.  I think I've been battling my demons, but it's so hard to make out the good from the bad.  I'm torn between faith in  myself and God , and  knowing what works .  I know that living on faith works, but it's a very hard thing to trust.  I've seen it work many times, I've even  trusted  it many times.  But I don't yet understand it.  Fear is a lot of my problem.  Fear of the unknown.  How can one live on what his talents alone provide?  How can all the pieces come together just right so that it's possible to live off of my own abilities?  And most importantly... Can I handle it?  I see it's possibilities, but the unknown permeates it all.  I think conquering my problems one small step at a time, has really been the solution all along.  But I find it becoming more and more complicated by 'possibilities'.  I could take this small thing that I've done and take it to the next level.  I could take this small thing and do it HERE and do it THIS way and it will bring all the success I have longed for.  These  possibilities  are where failure inevitably intervenes.    I don't know, it all sounds like mindless babbling to me.  The only thing I do know, is that I started swimming 4 months ago and I could barely finish 10 laps.  And now I effortlessly do 50.  And I suspect that 4 months from now I will do twice that.  And I know that the caricatures will get better too with each month of doing them.  And doing comic books and everything else will get better with each month.  As long as I'm consistent.  But the planning.. and the possibilities are where I keep getting tripped up.  Counting the money before it's made, taking the next step before I've finished the first, making plans to do something before my talents are even ready to meet that promise.  I'm sabotaging myself with potential.  It's a whole way of thinking that I'm having to force myself to change.  Something else I've found.  One of the inherent problems with facing your demons, is facing all the consequences and repercussions that you avoided (or ignored) while you were letting convenience (laziness) and fears rule your life.  I've had a lot of those consequences come up this week, and I'm afraid they are only the tip of the iceberg.  But I find that in facing my problems, I receive more of the tools I need to deal with them.  How do I know that?  I believe very much in the saying that 'God never gives us more than we can handle.'  And the reason that consequences are surfacing now, is because I'm ready to deal with them.  It's painful admitting how wrong I was about some things.  It's painful accepting mistakes.  But I know in time, I will find complete peace in knowing I've conquered them.  And hopefully I can continue on this path until they are all conquered.  I want to find peace in  living .    --Will   Now about this song... I wanted to share it with ya'll.  It's the song that gives me some of the greatest comfort in my life.  I'm not sure why, I can't really explain it.  Maybe it's the simplicity of it, or all the memories associated with it, or maybe it's the rousing chant of 'Everything's gonna be alright!' in the middle of the song.  But whenever I listen to it, I find myself peacefully soaking into my mind and ready to face whatever struggle brought me down to begin with.  I found this song again last night, and it brought me back to the surface of my life.  Taking in a deep breath of the air I'd been struggling to breathe.  It brought me... peace.     No Woman No Cry   Said I remember, when we used to sit. In the government yard in Trenchtown. Observing the hypocrites, as they would mingle with the good people we meet. Good friends we've had, and good friends we've lost, ...along the way. In this great future, you can't forget your past. So dry your tears I say. No woman, No cry. No Woman No Cry. Woman and sister, don't shed no tear No woman no cry.  Said I remember, when we used to sit, In the government yard in trenchtown. and then Georgie would make a fire light and that wood log would burn in through the night and we would cook corn meal porridge of which I'll share with you My feet... is my only carriage So I've got to push on through. But while I'm gone.  Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna be alright Everythings gonna BE alright Everythings gonna be alright  So woman don't cry.

       " \"                             Superbowl Sunday!   So, here I am in Hungary, and thanks to Marti's mom, she's ordered  urlLink Sport1  for 1 day so that I can watch   urlLink Superbowl XXXVIII  ! I still don't know if I can get the broadcast in English or not, but I don't much care. Ignoring the fact that I haven't really kept up with football since Marti and I got here, only just learning who's playing a few days ago, watching the  urlLink Superbowl  is just one of those  once a year American things to do . Even when I didn't much like football, we still had Superbowl parties. And now I get to watch, though it starts at 12:00 midnight here. :w00t w00t:  It's almost kick off time!!!!     Multiplatformication   Yesterday I was chatting with Dave and Jason, and Jason pointed something interesting out. With 3 people, we were having a chat (AIM Chat) on 3 platforms: me on Linux using  urlLink GAIM , Jason on Mac OS X using  urlLink iChat , and Dave on Windows XP using  urlLink Trillian . There weren't any issues with actually having the chat, and after Jason made the comment, it got me thinking - we've come a long way in making everything work on everything.   On all 3 major platforms, as I not counting  urlLink BeOS / urlLink Zeta Yellotab ,  urlLink Amiga ,  urlLink QNX , or some of the smaller-population distributions, we can communicate using IM (be it AIM, Yahoo!, MSN, ICQ, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, Zephyr, etc.), we can all share documents (PDF, DOC (though not contractually supported under Linux), XLS), and share files and printers when on the same network. Using VNC and Remote Desktop technologies, we're widing the spectrum of operating platforms one can use.   While I use Linux, I still use  urlLink Microsoft Office  (2002/XP). I support projects like  urlLink OpenOffice.org  (an open-source fork of  urlLink Sun Microsystem 's StarOffice Suite), and while they aren't quite there yet with the compatibility I'm looking for, they are getting  very close . Already in OpenOffice.org Calc, their spreadsheet application, there is support for using Microsoft Excel spreadhseets, and a greater number of functions available, making the product exceed Excel in areas. I'd actually like to get an opinion of OpenOffice.org Calc from Brad, since he's the Excel Guru, and see if it's as usable for him as Excel is. For documents on Mac, Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit (MBU) already produces Office for Mac. So for interoperability in the documents arena, it's there.  All this proves that, even though a lot of people have a different way of approaching something, we're increasing the ability to have a choice. I run Linux because it runs faster than Windows on my now-pathetic laptop, I can customize the install to my tastes, and I can run any and all software I could possibly need, be it a server, database, firewall, etc. Jason runs OS X for his reasons, and I'll be joining him soon when I buy  my replacement laptop. Dave runs XP because it's worked for him so far, but he wants to learn Linux because the company he works for is deploying Linux. So all this choice means that we can run whatever platform we want and still be able to use our computers with the rest of the world.  There's still   plenty   of room for improvement, but a lot of this would have to come from either hackers being able to simulate enough for open sourced releases, or Microsoft becoming a little more accepting of the fact that Windows isn't the only platform out there. Why can't jason sync his PocketPC device with Apple's  urlLink iSync ? Palm support is already there, but Microsoft needs to work with Apple to have their PDA-platform work on an Apple platform. There's money to be made off of Apple users using PocketPC devices, so why not simplify the process? That's my Microsoft's MBU exists in the first place.    'Once you go Mac, you never go back.' - Jason Lindsay   In the aforementioned chat with Jason and Dave, Jason made this comment. And I have to say it's true. About 2 years ago, I bought an Apple Powermac 9600/233 off eBay. I liked it so much that a little down the road, I bought an Apple Powermac G3/300 Beige Tower, again off eBay, to run OS X 10.1. I sold the Powermac 9600 to Jason, and then over the next year, there was a bit of swapping going on - he threw a G4/450 upgrade CPU into the PMac 9600, but wanted the speed of the bus and the native OS X support with the G3, so we swapped. I had to sell the PMac 9600 before I moved, and I'm now having Mac withdrawl.  With the prospect of school looming on the horizon, I've removed the thought of a subnotebook for my laptop replacement. Instead, I've opted for an Apple Powerbook, though I'm not sure about getting either the 15' model or the 17' model. Part of this is because doing work on the larger screen will be helpful, but most of it is to quench my thirst for Mac. Since my experience with Mac, I think I'm changed for the better. I can have a wonderful GUI experience, and with OS X's BSD4.4 underpinnings, I will still have the capability to run Open Source software. There's even the option of running dual-boot with Yellow Dog Linux or Gentoo/PPC, though, as  urlLink Amit Singh  would say, I would rather not deal with a multi-boot system on the hardware.   For schoolwork, I'll have all that I need for a development environment and a hardware platform that can run the latest-and-greatest without missing a beat. So, a Powerbook it is. The purchase will be a colossal event, happening after I can get my student card, and will be occuring at the Apple Store in Tyson's Corner. I'm one for instant-gratification, and I can get the student discount right there by showing my Student ID. So here's hoping for next January!                       \",\n",
       " \"                             The Ghost In Me.   So, positive thinking didn't work exactly as I had hoped.  It got me drawing.  That's good.  But I haven't really been productive.  Something is better than nothing I suppose.  I feel really unfocused right now.  There are two or three things that I  need  to be working on.  But when I can't focus on  which  one, that's when I tend to start  another  project.  Brandon told me a couple weeks ago I need to work on my priorities.  But I've yet to get my mind settled enough to even think about it.  Maybe it's another stall tactic.  Subliminally I'm avoiding what I need to do, by fuzzing it up with indecision.  I don't know what it is.  At least when I'm drawing every day, I don't feel completely worthless.  But I need to get focused soon - times running out on some of these projects.  I hate being so undisciplined.  They're tearing down this massive grain silo on the edge of town.  I never thought I'd have such an emotional reaction to an eyesore like that.  But every time I drive past, it makes me a little sadder.  Before, each time I saw it, it was a stoic reminder of my Grandfather... he built that massive wall of concrete.  Along with hundreds of other buildings in Lubbock.  From the Godbold Cultural center (formerly St Marys hospital) To J&B Coffee shop's building, which in its day was originally a movie theater.  But that grain silo... I thought it would be there forever.  I guess, in a sense, I thought the same about my GrandDad.  But alas, they're knocking it down, one careless swing at at a time.  Progress can suck my big fat hairy toe.   I think I still carry a great deal of guilt with me over my Granddad passing away.  He was my biggest supporter.  My biggest fan (next to my Dad).  But he never got to see me succeed.  In fact, the last thing he witnessed was a string of my biggest failures.  To tell the truth, I don't think I've ever succeeded in the way I wanted, for him to feel proud of me.  I mean, he didn't have high standards, or great expectations of me.  But he left a very big legacy.  One that I may never surpass.  He was ambitious, and highly disciplined.  He was a noble and principled man.  And he did it all, lived a HUGE life.  He was a carpenter, a construction foreman, a teacher.  He trained Glider Pilots in World War II.  Was superintendent of a school district.  And he was a devout, disciplined Christian to his dying day.        And my whole childhood until I became a man, I think he always thought I could do better.  And it wasn't until way too late that I realized that he did it because... he loved me.  I mean, it's the same pressure last year, that I was putting on all those I loved.  It wasn't disappointment, or condescending, it was love.  Though it was very easy to misconstrue.  He wanted me to do my best in everything, because he knew I have that in me... somewhere.  So I went most of my life, intimidated by this amazing man.  Wanting so badly to please him, but feeling like I failed at every turn.  He was always very saddened by how overweight I was, and of course, so was I.  But we've all seen here how hard that was to turn around.  And he wanted to support my comic book stuff, he even helped fund it at many turns, which made the failures all the more humiliating before him.  When I closed up my store, I didn't even want to face him, I was so embarrassed.  I remember thinking, 'I can become successful really quick somehow, and that will make up for all of this..'  But it never happened.  He passed away a week after I closed the store.  That's what I think about every time I find myself wasting opportunity.  That's all I can think about now.  How disappointed he would be.  And that grain silo disappearing, bit by bit... makes me feel like he's disappearing bit by bit.  And the more time I waste the less there will be left of him to remind me of how proud he would be when I finally  do  succede.  I know it's stupid.  But it is as it is.  I don't know how his incredible discipline got so badly lost in translation from his life to mine.  Maybe he was overbearing with my Dad, or maybe it was how my parent's style of 'discipline' were completely diametrically opposed that we ended up with almost none.  I don't know... and it doesn't matter.  But it is one of my greatest struggles.  I know that it is tied to everything I hope to do with my life.  From work to money to every day living.  And not to mention my  own  kids.  So that's the struggle that I need to keep coming back to here.  I need to understand 'discipline'.  And I need to stop living with this Ghost.   --Will                     \",\n",
       " \"                             This week, outside of my Netflix flicks (say that three times real fast), I've watched most of a serial entitled  The Phantom Menace . This was part of a two-serial set I bought a Sam's (I also recently got a Sherlock Holmes set -- four movies!). Being from 1935, I didn't expect a great deal of depth or super special effects (everybody  knows  special effects didn't exist until  Star Wars  in 1976, right? but IMDb says that two guys worked on special effects -- something must be wrong).    Yes, it's cheesy; the video quality is pretty poor; the audio drops out occasionally; the effects are pretty minimal; the cliffhanger endings are cheated horribly; and the subtitles, if enabled, just show 'AUDIO' occasionally rather than actual speaking parts, as though someone forgot to master the words onto the track. Well, it's a lot of fun.     I kept thinking while watching it, though, how could the story be updated and appeal to modern audiences? No singing cowboy (sorry, Mr. Autry, though you did okay for the time) for our day. Special effects can be better, for sure. For one, they could actually exist. Hey, if 'The Outer Limits' can do okay with the serviceable yet unspectacular effects, we could probably do okay, too. The biggest problem would be to find a motivation for a bunch of kids to get together to form the Junior Thunder Riders. Okay, I'll stop now. (though I would love to develop my five-year plan for a TV version of  Reign of Fire  -- more dragons!)            \",\n",
       " \"                             Today I got a ride to work! The woman who gave me a ride saw me walking down the street and thought that she recognized me. Turns out she did. Her name is MM and she works downstairs. She somehow knew it was me even though the last time she saw me I had long brown har instead of short blond hair. Most people seem to have trouble recognizing me at first. I asked her about this and she didn't really know how she knew it was me. I think I have a distinctive walk maybe. I have a nice lil swagger on the boundry of a pimp stride... haha, no not really.                      Anyways it was kind of nice to get a ride into work. It is actually kind of chilly out today and the wind was blowing. I was carrying in my suit that I had made for Otakon, so I could get the pants made to where they actually fit. The suit was blowing around and I was tired of carrying it. So warm car was a much better option.                       She lives in the same quadrant of the city as the building we work in. I wondered why she was in the north section of town and asked her about it. She said it was because she was dropping off a friend of hers to work. I would drive to work myself... but it would cost to park unless I park farther south in the residential part, but then I would be walking for 10-15 minutes anyways. The excercise is pretty good for you anyways! I will probably start biking once it gets a bit cooler out. MM had off today but she was still going in to pick up some slack. I don't think I want any job where that happens to me. No going in on weekends or anything like that. Although I am a nice guy and could see myself getting pressured into some shit like that.                     Grrr... on a different note I have been watching Love Hina on my WinAmp player. The internet TV is the most awesomest thing ever! As long as the server is not full then you can watch some episodes of streaming anime. They also have a selection of porn which I readily started watching the internet TV for. But  urlLink Love Hina  captured my heart, mostly because it is funny and they beat up the main character a lot.  My roommate said it reminded him of the same animation as  urlLink Mahoromatic  , which is also pretty cool. but.. if you have the chance, please take a look at some of these classic anime series. Maybe someday I will meet a girl who will enjoy the silly things I enjoy someday. Then she will be my best friend...  One thing that sucked about the ride to work I guess was that I got here 15 minutes early, and I don't get to leave 15 minutes early :-(          \",\n",

Give full soverignty to the interim Iraqi government.&nbsp; I admit, the    United States appears to be giving a good job of this, but heed my    warning:&nbsp; anything that makes Americans look like occupiers will give    ammunition to radical Islamics to keep hurting any Americans that are in the    Arab world.     Stop talking about this war in terms of 'good' and 'evil'.&nbsp; Indeed,    this can be really tempting at some times, such as the recent beheading, but    the fact of the matter is that these ideas are relative; therefore, it can    make perfect sense to them to call us evil, which they do.     Most importantly, find out what makes certain Islamics declare America    evil.&nbsp; I have my theories, and you may have yours (and would probably    make a good topic for next week's column), but the most important step in    resolving any conflict is understanding why the other party feels how they    do.&nbsp; For al-Qaeda, the chances of this happening could very well be slim    to nil, but there are many other respectable Islamic clerics in the world, and    it is imperative to understand just what makes us the enemy.    These steps are only a beginning, but in order to finish any journey, you  must take the first step.&nbsp; I can only hope that America does soon, lest  this turbulence consumes us all.            \",\n",

All for $695 on eBay. It's effectly a desktop replacement for her, with a PIII-667, 256MB RAM, 64MB Radeon, and 17' CRT (15' viewable).   I'll be reloading this thing with a fresh non-OEM WinXP Pro install for her (if she wants me to, she may want to keep the OEM XP Home install for now - even the Compaq default install doesn't slow this thing down!).

We really dont' care how childish it is because it's not if you dare and truth the right tpye of things. Like Tom...he jumped into the pool at 11 pm naked...we only told him to jump in the pool...he did the naked part on his own...Candice knows I hate beer so I stuck to my vodka and pepsi.When's the last time i had that either? Hmm...I dont even remember the garbage I said or did two hours ago...that can't be good. I hate being an easy drunk!                   Mom made banana muffins today and I took sum to work. Yum...fresh home made goodness... Anywho, there were a bunch of retard kids that walked into the store asking us shit questions and being retards when they were probably my age and older. I fucking hate kids like that. I told my manager how much I hate seeing people my age act like shit heads and he said 'you should have said to them -why are you guys being retards?- and if they said anything to me about what you said I'd say, -she didn't say that. what are you talking about?- and i don't think the rest of the customers in the store would have cared if you said anything.' lol i should have sid sumthin to them damn it!

I love that noise of the blow off valve....taht thing is so cool....it's gonna scare the shitty ricers in my neighbourhood. I hate it when they try racing the benz...it's like 'okay...we're not racing you' so when they drive off when the light turns green and we just mind our own business, what does it prove? Honestly...stupid cambridge kids...                    I get paid....omg it's 1 am! that means I got paid! Woohoo! I better check how much money I have...it'll probably be zero by tomorrow....yeah...i owe my mom and my brother money....damn it.                    I went to Karate and got my hair cut today. How great. It felt nice having my hair fixed up! Paul is the greatest guy ever. The sensei and the hair stylist all in one....though he hasn't taught me for 4 years. But man, Kelly taught me some new moves in class today...it completely threw me off from the old style to the new style...now i know why I can't wear my red belt anymore since I last taught there...I'm a white belt again! *Cries* nah, actually it's cool. It's neat that I have another goal to get to again.                     Guess i'm off to bed now.

What the game is themed on primarily this time, (different from the previous style of a Mario copy) is speed based mayhem which is much more traditonaly sonic like. From the start where the character gets on the starting blocks for a 'race' to the end where bonus points are added according to how fast you were going across the finish line. Even the bosses are speed based, with robotnics car thingy continuosly running away from you, with you having to catch up and bounce him. The annoying pop up spikes at the end of every glorious run heavily featured in the first game are no were to be seen. Tedious jumping is also absent and best of all the stupid character Amy Rose isn't featured (well she's unlockable but who cares). Amy is replaced by a much more worthy rabbit called cream who like Tails can fly. She has a chao flollowing her (the little baby things from sonic adventure) allowing for unique fun tricks and skills, like sending 'cheese' the chao homing in on enemies in mid flight. In most levels its possible to hold the right d-pad down and get through the level, although you may not get the spec. Rings and experience the level it exemplifies the fluidity of this new rendition. Tricks added to jumps allow for secret areas to be reached and lightning fast runs, especially with the new speed mechanics pushing the character off the screen all create a true classic. If looking for a new game to pass the time I recommend this game totally. Its a much better game than the last one for gba and worth my money.  If you cant find it in the store use  urlLink eBay . Internet trading is the future and you should support it. Its also quite cheap and if you're not buying the game for release purposes you should buy it on eBay.       \",\n",

Well I am not sure how many of you share your views with me on this very special genre of music, The Public Transport Music should I call it?. In India, most of the public transport vehicles have a Cassette Player fitted in them, and a dozen of very special cassettes having songs which you would have never even heard of. Be them the Deadly City Buses of Indore, Crowded Buses of the DTC(Delhi Transport Corporation) or the Dashing Vikrams of Kanpur, they all cater this very special choice of music to you. Theres one more special thing about their cassette players, normally the speed of their rotor is very high and the songs are played on a little higher frequency, this adds to the uniqueness of these wierd songs. The lyrics are cheap and music too is not very sweet but still its good to listen to at times. Sometimes I found them really funny. Recently DTC has taken this initiative to have Radio Tuners in the CNG Rickshaws. Thats one good move atleast that RPM problem can be sorted out. I dont know how many of you have tasted this music, but if you ever get to use the of public transport in India, you will surely listen to this music. They constitute the largest consumer group of music companies like T-Series.  --- One Trailor (Hindi Only!! English cannot express it that good) ----  A typical Radiowala's voice :  Super Cassette industries aur Gulashn Kumar pesh karte hai   A crashing female voice :  Aaja*alternate echoes of male and female voice* (If you are in Kanpur you might overhear your neigbors talking wow what gr8 sound effects )   A typical Radiowala's voice :  Aaja Meri Jaan* A song starts to play somethign like Julie Julie Julie ... and the female starts to sing: Mai jal rahi hoon tere pyaar mein*   A typical Radiowala's voice :  Aur is aag ko bhujhane aa raha hai naya romantic chehra jee haan doston Kishan Kumar   A crashing female voice :  in sureele gaano ka romantic sangeet diya hai annu malik ne aur khoobsoorat geet likhe hain xyz ne  I am sure all those who can understand this would be laughing their guts out ... so were me and my friend and the poor rickshaw guy cud only managed to ask us 'Bhaiya badal doon kya'          \",\n",

You know…Going to church just because you have to…Craning your neck around the room looking for cute girls…Sleeping while pretending to pray solemnly…those kinds of things. I never really took going to church seriously. For me, it was just a waste of a good Sunday morning you can use for something important like sleeping, gimmicks, computer games et cetera. My parents also went church-hopping from time to time, looking for better pastors who won’t talk nonsense. We went on like this until the summer of 2004. My family was part of this new church called Victory at Fort Bonifacio which we joined a couple of months prior. This was where I met Joaquin. I’ve seen him lots of times around the church. He was one of the lead singers of the pop group 17:28 and, as his profession suggests, one of the more prominent singers in our church’s music ministry. On top of all that, he was very popular among guys and girls alike. He told me he was going to be my “cell leader”…whatever that means. A couple of days after, he sent me a text message saying that we were going to have a “cell meeting” on Saturday. I hesitated at first, but finally thought, “Sure…It’s worth a shot…maybe I’ll even get to meet a couple of cute girls.” That Saturday, I went to Starbucks to meet with Joaquin. Little did I know, though, that this thing they called a “cell meeting” would change my life forever.',\n",

I dont look forward to getting my liscense renewed. I guess you could say that my boyfriend Brian and I are goth if your into the whole labeling thing. I love my Brian! We've been together now for 7 months, I know that doesn't seem like a real long time and that Im only 16 and I don't know shit about anything, but I do know that I love him. My first serious relationship lasted 2 years and 7 months with a duchebag named Andy. He broke me, even though I left him for Brian...he still broke my heart during our relationship. That's why I'm glad to say that I love my Brian and he's nothing like that faggot. Yes I was engaged to him, but come on he asked when I was 14..any girl would be flattered into saying yes. However, since Ive had a little expierence in that department, I know not to just say yes to anyone. Brian isn't just Anyone. He's everything that I've ever wanted. Sure he has flaws as if any human, but they're flaws that I love about him and wouldn't ask him to change in a million years. Okay, so you all think I'm crazy, (which I am) but if you ever have fallen in love you know what I mean. Well, lets see what else is there to tell, now that you know some of my personal relationship buisness. I love death metal, black metal, and nu metal. My favorite band is Slipknot. However,their new album is rather depressing. It sounds more like Stone Sour. But some other bands I like are(in no particular order) Iron Maiden, Cannibal Corpse, Marilyn Manson, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, Mortician, Dark Tranquilty, Dream Theater, Journey and a lot more that I cant think of. Some of my favorite movies are Donnie Darko, Nightmare on Elm Street (1st one), Dawn of the Dead (the original), Walking Tall, and I really liked The Day After Tomorrow. I used to work at Chick-fil-a and it sucked. Now I have to find another job soon because Im going to be in CO. OP. which sucks. I dont want to do it. It takes up so much time. Although I'll have more money..and I can start saving to move out. Although I probably wont move out until Im 23 but whatever. It's to hard to make it on your own without money, which means go to college, have a part time crap job, and save as much as you can while sponging off your parents and living with your boyfriend in a small bedroom at home..yeah thats my life for the next 7 years. Im looking forward to it..and your looking forward to reading about it. Lucky you! Oh yes, if you think I do drugs your nuts. I've smoked weed only twice, and I was 15. I didn't like it and have never done it again. I despise drugs. That's why I lost my best friend because she turned to drugs to solve her problems instead of me. I don't drink, I don't like alcohol either really. Just some for the taste, but not to get drunk..alcoholism runs in my family, and I don't want to get addicted. No way to spend your life or your money. I used to smoke, since like 6th grade off and on. Currently I quit and hope to stay that way. It's so bad for your lungs, I know its addicting believe me,even though I know how bad it is, I still crave one every now and then. Mainly whenever I'm around my friends that smoke. I'm more of a social smoker. Kind of like those that are social drinkers..except you can't get drunk off of a cig. Well, I have to shower now because I'm going to see the Love of my Life in a few! I love Brian so Much!! Later Maggots!                 \",\n",

I get off of school go to practice an than home to do whatever homework I can do before I have to go to work, everything I don't finish I have to do when I get home at 11:00  or later.  The thing that gets me is a lot of peope do this and we all do for minimum  or slightly higher wages.  We all complain about it and we often come to school looking like zombies because of the lack of sleep.

       " '                            I read  Ecological Disaster: Cleaning Up the Hidden Legacy of the Soviet Regime  by Murray Feshbach last night.  The book (actually a report from 1994) is a good intro to the ecological problems left behind by the Soviet Union.  While 10 years old, it does serve as a primer for the problems that Russia and the former Republics face and as provides an historical foundation upon which to build with further research.  The main problem the Russians faced then, and face today, is the collapse in health care and the demographic crash that is overtaking the country.  For the world, the problems are probably worse, as we have to deal with the legacy of 70 years of communist mismanagement and almost pathological disregard for the environment and the last 13 years of corruption and scarcity of resources for cleaning up the mess.   This is an issue that still receives too little public attention.  While it is important to clean up and monitor the environment at home, it is of equal, if not greater, importance to focus on regenerating the environment that was once part of the Soviet Empire.

       " \"                            It was Friday, a night to go to the movies. It was also my day off also until the weekend of The Pride Parade. I decided I must do something until I work  tomorrow. So I went to my old job, AMC Theatres on Van Ness. I got off and there were poltical supporters for John Kerry, democratic candidate. In the process, I saw a huge line, then I remembered. There were people in line for Fahrenheit 9/11, the new documentary from Michael Moore. All of the showings were SOLD OUT. So I bought a ticket to the Nicholas Sparks' based novel, 'The Notebook'. I still had time until my show started, so I walk around. About fifteen minutes later, for moment a thought a show was available for 7:00 pm. I stood in line until a fellow moviegoer was selling a leftover ticket. I bought the ticket from him, now I was going to see the new Michael Moore flick. The crowd was already gone and a new crowd for the next showing stood in. I walked past the escalators to the top floor.                I reached the concession stand and bought my food. I went inside the theater and saw people had taken the best seats. I was afraid there weren't anymore seats and without thinking I shouted, 'ARE THERE ANYMORE SINGLE SEATS?!' Everyone looked at me like I was a crazy person. Most people had thought I was selling an extra ticket. I felt like a dumb ass because I found a decent seat by the stairs when someone had saw me stand right by them. I sat down there mortified, sort of. When I sat down, I heard someone say, 'She didn't have to shout like that.' Right there, I put my hand over my mouth and made a snicker. I didn't really care.             After five minutes of commercials from not using your cell phone in the theater to seeing a Hershey's kisses commercial twice to watching five coming attraction films. The movie started.          The documentary was awesome,I especially like the behind the scenes stuff before the politcal advisors go on air. Also watching Bush's blank and solemn reaction when 9/11 occurred. Overall this is Michael Moore's best yet behind 'Bowling For Columbine'.      I remember I had a ticket for 'The Notebook' and I was going to get refund but decided not to. So I had some time left, I went to 'Mel's Drive In' and bought an Chocolate Milk Shake. I had traded in my ticket and saw the next showing, it was a Friday night, why not?     I watched the romantic film, though I haven't read the novel. It had to be a tearjerker film. Though it was romantic and poignant. It wasn't like 'A Walk To Remember' with Mandy Moore. I still love it, nonetheless.      I had my share of watching films, I can't wait for Spiderman 2.       \",\n",

First off, some people had signs up for glomps. ?- I have no idea what a glomp is and I was very confused by this. And it kind of made me pissed off that these people were confusing me, since I am supposed to be reasonably intelligent. I guess I will send an e-mail to the people of Otakon and ask em what is up.                  Friday I was there by myself and figured I would wander around for a while. I wanted to watch the Anime Music Videos since I thought they weren't going to be playing them that often, but I was wrong! They played it like 10 or 12 times so I could have just watched it the next day with my friends and not be seeing it for the 2nd time.  I went to the 'otaku-rave' (one word?) and saw lots of interesting dancing, although I can't talk since I didn't dance myself. It wasn't that the music wasn't good, it was pretty awesome. I just felt a bit weird dancing without people that I knew there. Didn't want to be just dancing 'by myself' I suppose, that and most of the people there were under 20.  So.. I went to a discussion on adult entertainment instead. They discussed lots of interesting differences between American and Japanese porn.  Like the fact that pretty much all of Japanese porn is legally bound to blur out actual penetration. They showed clips and everything! The bukkake film that they showed was hilarious. Right before the guys with blurred penises got to jerk off (I think they might just be blurred while jerking off at this point) on this girl this one guy from off camera ran up and spooged right at her. She was not prepared at all and she jumped up as the guy jizzed on her and the guy next to her. They must have rewound that clip 20 times. They also discussed 'rape' videos and rope bondage and hentai and all of the other kooky stuff that originated in Japan. It was very informative. Especially when they said that Asian people have smaller penises than the American guys in porn. At least this gave me a good thought to have for the rest of the night and a little bit right now 'my penis is big compared to Asian penis' hooray for me. After the panel I went back to J and E's apartment and wondered how E's girlfriend... whose name also starts with an E was doing. Because E and E2 were at the emergency room since E2 was having stomach problems. Turns out it was some kind of cyst and it was causing her troubles. I decided to have beer to celebrate her being alright later.                  I saw some interesting anime. This one called  urlLink Risky Safety  was pretty interesting even though they showed us episodes starting at the 9th one. This, made it very confusing. There was a little witch guy (risky) with a scythe and sometimes turned into a little angel (safety) and they were friends with this girl and then it changed to this other girl... WTF, anyways, the episodes were only 10 minutes long which made them... kind of annoying with the previews for the next episode happening twice before you saw it. I was also hung over on Saturday and Sunday since I went out drinking at my friends' place after 'the con'. I only had four hours of sleep friday night and was pretty dehydrated. Sunday, I didn't go back to Otakon because it was raining pretty hard out and I was wholly unmotivated mostly because my camera ran out of battery power (that piece of crap). I got to see my cousin at the convention as well. He went to drink with me Saturday night. I got him to do a flaming shot which I didn't partake in since 151 doesn't really seem that appealing. Although fire is appealing, very sensual, just not when I know that the 151 'tastes like burning'. Good times, although there were so many  urlLink Inuyashas  there I had wondered if maybe I was supposed to go as him too but just forgot. I picked up some MegaTokyo manga and got the hell outta there. After watching Zatoichi: the blind swordsman first tho. And I must say that if you love samurai and cool fight scenes then you should watch this movie. enough for now :-P I am always making really long posts, and no-one is likely to read them, so what do I care (but I guess I should get back to work).           \",\n",
       " \"                            Note: I take my computers my seriously and become (sometimes overly) protective of them. I am not mentally unstable or crazy.  WARNING: Lots of whining.    My laptop, Rika, who would have been 5 years of age this coming June, passed away on the operating table today while this technician tried to revive her. She had been having some serious issues lately as I shortly mentioned in  urlLink January , again in  urlLink February  and last noted in  urlLink March . Then this morning, after not being opened for the past week or so (remotely accessed), when opening the lid the left hinge cover and left hinge SNAPPED. Metal and plastic snapping sounds coming from a laptop are NOT HEALTHY. The display fired up, showed me my gdm login screen and about 30 seconds later went  FIZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz...  POP!  . LCD died.  Hard booted. LCD came back for maybe 5 seconds and then died, albeit this time without noise this time. I decided to see if I could find out what that pop noise was, and began removing the display bezel and the rear bezel. Low and behold, with the bezels off and things 'floating' freely, the display worked for about a minute... then died. Removing the LCD panel from the bezel showed one of the first problems - the display ribbon cable shows signs of heat damage. Then I found the pop noise. The non-ground wire for the power to the LCD (the pink wire) had it's insulation brunt off and was literally dangling by a thread. Taking the bezel off had moved it back to enough of a connection to power it, but breathing on it wrong caused it to loose it's connection again. I have declared Rika dead at 12:48 CET (GMT +1).  However, all is not TOTALLY lost. I can still ping her IP after waiting for the hard drive to stop on bootup. Luckily I have sshd startup, so I can still remotely connect to her, but as for functioning as a laptop or even usable desktop or workstation, she is lost to me. After 5 hard years in the service of Adam, then Wes, then me, then Bobbo, then back to me for the last 2.5 years, I think it is time to finally let her rest.  But I have now lost my computer. True, there are Marti's desktop (which I'm on right now) and Marti's laptop - but convincing her to load even Starcraft (let alone Baldur's Gate) on her desktop is like convincing  Richard Stallman  that Microsoft is a good guy. It's even more difficult when it comes to her laptop.  Alis is 5,000 miles away on the other side of the ocean and would involve me going back to get her over here [ie. it's not going to happen]. Upon realizing I just said that, it's hard to imagine that I went from running 6-8 computers at any given time (PDAs and laptops not included in that total) to now being at a singular. Wow.

Funny isn't it?      &nbsp;   Tapi hal ini juga berarti manusia bisa mengalami kemunduran dalam hal komunikasi aktif dua arah yang bagus    dalam artian kita kehilangan 'sense of spontanity'. Spontanitas kita dalam berkomunikasi dengan orang tu    bisa jadi terganggu apalagi kalo apa-apa kita lewat SMS mulu. Bilang 'good night' lewat SMS,     bilang 'i love u' lewat sms, bilang 'aku sayang kamu' and macem-macem lagi. Kalo gini justru nanti     giliran uda ketemu face to face malah kagok bilang 'aku sayang kamu'. Hal seperti ini bisa-bisa aja terjadi...     &nbsp;   Well, the point is  'even though we got lot of ease of saying       things through SMS or MMS.. whatever you called it.. don't forget the old ways of expressing your       feelings to people surround you, people you love, and people you care about.'             \",\n",
       " \"                            So I was feeling low on cash until I received my tax return. I had won a pair of Giants tickets from work. The thing is I missed five innings because I was doing a final that night. I finished my final and The Giants were neck to neck. This was when they were playing The Colorado Rockies. So I got the good part of the game, they were lower box seats and I was on the tenth row near the pitcher's mound. Toward the end, one of the players(I forgot whom)hit a base hit and The Giants won. Two days later I bought good club seat tickets on my own and the game seem like the other team would win. Then unexpectedly Barry Bonds hits number 671 home run. It was against Cinncinati, I think. But the crowd was cheering and it was the best night yet. All Giants baseball fans went home happy that night. I kept the stubs and my mother's friend Kai, who is the game's saxophone player, played my all time favorite tune,'You Are My Sunshine'. That night was a good night. This event had happened during Memorial Day weekend on Friday, May 28th.             Last week, Rari, my hair stylist canceled on me. So I did the next best thing. I went to my local hair salon called The Salon and I got my hair done there. Though I admit I paid more there, I at least got my hair done. I got many compliments at work, even The Bastard liked it. I only had two regular customers insulted me. One customer who I will now referred to as 'The Hag' called me Wanda the Witch. When she called me that I secretly gave her the F**K you sign behind her back under the register, so no one can see. Then I told my co- worker Priscilla, 'Always remember the compliments, forget the insults'. I was referencing the song I heard the year I gratuated high school. It was Baz Luhrmann's 'Everybody is Free To Wear Sunscreen' song. I love my hair it is me. I am the kind of woman who is the 'Middle Of the Road' type and doesn't care what anyone thinks because I am JenniferJuniper.                   \",\n",

       " \"                            This pertains to the Swift Boat sailors that I mentioned  earlier . Their  new book  will be released on August 15, 2004. This article from  NewsMax.com  offers some tantalizing highlights...        A new book written by the Swift Boat sailors who served with John Kerry in Vietnam offers a devastating critique of his military record. According to Drudge Report, 'Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry,' written by John O'Neill and Jerome R. Corsi, adds new details to revelations about Kerry's record. Among the bombshells Drudge reports: ~ All three of Kerry's Purple Hearts were for minor injuries, not requiring any hospitalization, and two were self-inflicted. ~ A 'fanny wound' was the highlight of his Bronze Star. ~ Kerry filed a false report to exploit the death of a Vietnamese father and child as an act of 'heroism.' ~ He burned an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the civilians' livestock. 'Kerry's reckless behavior convinced his colleagues that he had to go - becoming the only Swift Boat veteran to serve only four months,' Drudge reported. 'Unfit for Command,' scheduled for release Aug. 15, could do as much damage to Kerry as the entire year's packed lineup of Bush-bashing movies and books has done to the president. O'Neill, who served with John Kerry in Vietnam and has been exposing the Massachusetts Democrat's military record ever since, has terrified Kerry's presidential campaign with the explosive new book. As NewsMax has reported, O'Neill, a leader of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, has: ~ Forced Kerry in 1971 to admit he never witnessed the war crimes he had accused U.S. troops of committing.      Stated at a news conference last month: --> 'We resent very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming back from Vietnam in 1971 and repeated in the book 'Tour of Duty.'' --> 'We think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our unit and other units in Vietnam.' --> 'We think that he knew he was lying when he made the charges, and we think that they're unsupportable. We intend to bring the truth about that to the American people.' --> 'We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit to be the Commander-in-Chief.'      ~ Pointed out that despite the show staged at the Democrat convention, most of the officers in Kerry's division have signed a public letter saying he's unfit to lead. ~ Accused Kerry of exaggerating and even faking his wounds. 'He literally is a guy who parades around and pretends to be something he's not,' O'Neill said.      'He was in Vietnam for four months; everyone else was there for a year. He obtained three Purple Hearts from self-inflicted wounds. And then he left.'      ~ Urged Kerry to stop exploiting photos of fellow soldiers, many of whom oppose his candidacy. ~ Revealed how Kerry's campaign has tried to muzzle Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. O'Neill has explained:  'It's his self-promotion that infuriates most of the people from his unit who actually know what he did. He would be a terrible commander in chief of U.S. forces in the world at a time of crisis.'        It's no surprise to me that the Democrats are scrambling to stop this book from being published. All this from the people that knew John Kerry  best  during his infamous 'tour of duty?' This should be revelational news to those that support Kerry. Uh-oh Democrats... time for some damage control!       \",\n",
       " \"                            Though I am not Gay, I am a supporter. I decided to support my Uncle Ricky because he asked if I would carry a banner for his job along with his fellow drag queens and dukes. I not only participated, my mother did also. I can tell you my mother is wild and more free spirited than I. I am also, bt not as wild as her.                   The day started at 7 am in the morning, I wanted to break my alarm clock earlier because it woke me up at 5:15 am before I dozed off. I woke up later to eat pancakes my uncle had made. As usual my mother tends to procrastinate but this time she did better because she had done her laundry. My uncle had left already by the time it was 9 am and my mom and I left fifteen minutes later.       We walked into Walgreen's and saw our favorite vendor, Christian. In his usual and cheerful presence he rang up our purchases. Then my mother and I took a cab over to Beale and Folsom. The festivities were getting started.       We found the float and I help a transgender put on her rainbow customer on, feather boas, she looked like an NBC network mascot. Then I saw all of my Uncle's friends, they all know him as 'Renita Valdez'. To me his is my Uncle Ricky, to his fellow duchesses and dukes, he is known as 'Renita'.         I made the mistake of wearing my green sweatshirt and jeans because it was lukewarm outside, about 77 degrees, I think. I was lucky I had my black bra on and when the 2003 duchess, 'Donna Rae' said, 'To take it off', I went for it. I wrapped my sweatshirt around my jeans and my cleavage. I get slightly self-conscious because of my breast size.     The whole float waited for nearly two hours until we went on. I had to carry this banner along with my mother, myself, and another drag queen named 'Bonnie'. 'Bonnie', the drag queen is damn right ugly but is indeed a very nice person. He is the ugliest drag queen at least my 'Aunt Renita' looks better. But 'Bonnie' has yellow-gapish teeth and was dressed like the fairy tooth fairy from a demented hell. I had met 'Bonnie'  a couple weeks earlier.      Out 4 Justice was this year's Gay Pride theme because a lot on long-term couples had gotten married. Mayor Gavin Newsom had performed same sex marriages even though President Bush was against the policy. Every individual has the right to get married either if you're gay, straight, or in-between. I had the privilage to enjoy this wonderful event and I hope someday, congress will pass a civil marriage law.       My mother can be crazy at times, as the float was starting she had managed to get a six dollar gay pride whistle for free. It amazes me how my mother get things for free or discounted, she has the magic touch. Her persistence sometimes bothers me but she knows how to get her own way, I do too, but I am more subtle.    During the whole float, I am wearing my black bra and colorful beads. There is this shirtless lesbian in front of me with stickers plastered 'Lesbian 4 Sale'. I, too is tempted to go shirtless also, but I chicken out. Also while carrying this flimsy banner, 'Bonnie' is pushing me aside where I am also annoyed getting my foot stuck along the railing grate althrough Market Street.      After we arrived at 8th St and Market. I am craving for the munchies because it was around 1:30 or 2 pm when we got there. My mother convinces me to get a discount card, so that I can get discounted alcohol drinks. The first thing I get is a five dollar cup of lemonade. Later when my mom and I seperate (She needed to go back home to get more things). I withdraw some cash to buy a chocolate frozen banana with nuts, two bottles of water, fish and chips, a chicken kabob, and two alcoholic beverages; the watermelon Smirfoff kind (vodka) all in a period of two hours. I am a glutton for food and I was having the best time of my life.  The crowds were crazy: naked and creative. I had the enjoyment of watching lesbians, gays, trans of all kind,and straight making out along the Civic Center area and City Hall.      By the end I was a lush, a term use for drunk or plastered. I met up with my mother later on, after laying on a patch of grass while everyone around me passes me by and while listening to Chaka Kahn live at the Main stage near City Hall. I managed to find my mother near the Bud Light stand. She brought my purple lounge chair, so I sat there while my mother got more color beads and bought a funnel cake.  My mother had to sort of drag me to the 49 bus stop at Van Ness. I was wasted until I got to my room.  An hour later, my uncle bought Chinese Food. I was slightly sober then. I watched some tv and went to bed. I have to wake up at 5:15 tomorrow. Overall I had a Glutton Sunday, the best pride event,yet,eh?      \",\n",

       " \"                            Three Monkeys: 'Hear no evil, Speak no evil, See no evil' The trio of monkeys is depicted with one having its hands over its ears, another having its hands over its mouth, and the third having its hands over its eyes. Known as the Three Monkeys, they are a tradition in Japanese culture.  Beginning in the late Muromchi period (1333-1568), it became customary to carve these figures on koshinto, stone pillars used during the observance of Koshin. According to the Kiyu Shoran, an early 19th century reference work, the Three Monkeys may also be related to the Sanno belief complex, wherein monkeys play the role of divine messangers. The Three Monkeys represent the Santai (Three Truths) advocated the Tendai Sect of Buddhims. The Tendai founder, Saicho is said to have carved a representation of this ideal in the form of monkeys. (Japan. p. 1562-63)  A famous carving of the Three Monkeys is on the sacred stable in the Toshogu Shrine in Nikko, Japan. Carvings of monkeys were believed to prevent diseases in horses.            I thought that this article was very interesting because, I have been wanting to know about this saying for a very long time.

Every time it's brought up, someone points to David Brin's     The Transparent Society    . Now, Brin has written up a long (and somewhat rambling) piece for Salon that points out, whether we like it or not,    technology is forcing everyone to be more open   . It's not a question of whether the technology is good or bad, but how it's used. His suggestion is that it's time to embrace the technology of surveillance (and sousveillance) in order to make sure that it's used properly. Simply trying to stop the rise of cameras, RFIDs and closely connected databases is doomed to fail. And, even worse, by fighting against it, many privacy advocates are making sure that these things are set up so only 'they' (governments, corporations, someone who isn't you) have access -- leaving out any accountability. In a world where people are freaking out over camera phones, RFIDs and internet tapping, it's certainly an interesting read. Brin points out that all of these technologies have benefits when used properly, and even the negatives can be dealt with, if people really come up with ways to embrace the technology, rather than just deny its existence altogether.                 \",\n",

I then attempted to put in the booster seat; Kay is just too young for it. Donna insisted that I was doing it the wrong way, and after her using 2 seat belts to hold it down tight, about 30 minutes. We then had Kay sit in it, it was just not right, I asked Kay if she could get out of the seat and within 20 seconds she was out and all over the back seat. Chalk one up for me, I installed the other car seat and we are back to normal. Ha Ha, I was right again! We then went for a ride with Kay to see the boats, fun, but getting old, we need to find a new place to see more boats maybe. We went home and I took a bike ride around the area we live in, oh my god I am so out of shape it’s not even funny. I will continue to ride until it gets easier, I really need to do this, it will help me get some exercise, and it gets me out of the house and I get some fresh air.       I worked on the videos from the camcorder, ding bat lost a bunch of stuff because she can’t handle the rewind function on the camcorder, but we got a bunch of good video. I am going to get a fire wire cable so that future downloads come out a little clearer.       Today Donna and Kay are picking up Amy from  Levittown , should be interesting. I do not feel too wonderful right now, I still have the occasional chest pain here and there, and I am very tired. Today should be a real bore here at work again.

       " \"                            Writing lessons...   So I'm still working on the beginning of my script.  I hope this isn't a normal habit for me, I've already written most of the story, but I'm still working on the beginning, lol.  I've written it 3 different ways and none of them make me happy.  I want the first 5 pages to be fun, captivating AND relevant.  So I'm creating some rules I want to follow for introducing the main character and beginning the story.  I've always done this sort of thing, writing rules and such.  Especially when I was learning to draw.  It helped me to solidify what I was doing right and eliminate what I was doing wrong.  Its just that, now you poor readers are forced to be subjected to this meandering process and most of you don't give a goodgoddam about writing.  So I pologize now if this is boring.   Wilbos rules for gooder writin'  1.  The reader must care for the character before they care about the conflict. 2.  The character is developed not just by how they  Act  but by how other characters  React  to them.  3.  A Hero is the guy that  Knows  stuff... They're not the guy that  Learns  stuff. 4.  The Beginning is not where the story starts, it's where the reader starts.  So don't try to squeeze all of the history in before the reader even starts to care about the character.  5.  State your  thesis  in the opening, just as you would in a research paper.  If your story is to have a  purpose , you must state that purpose in the beginning, you must discuss it in the middle and prove it in the end. 6.  Write first-- think later!!!  So that's it so far.  At least for starting a story.  I think the thing I keep getting stuck on, is that I don't want to start in a straight-forward way.  I don't want to go the obvious route, because, well... It's been done more than a hollywood hooker.  So I'll keep chipping away at it.  I'll prolly post it up here when I get something more concrete written.   --Will                     \",\n",

At a restaurant: When you ask the waiter   Stupid Question: Is the &quot;Paneer Butter Masala&quot; dish good?   Answer: No, it&#18;s terrible and made of adulterated cement. We occasionally also spit on it.           5. At a family get-together: When some distant aunt meets you after years.   Stupid Question: Munna, Chickoo, you've become so big.   Answer: Well you haven't particularly shrunk yourself.           6. When a friend announces her wedding, and you ask...   Stupid Question: Is the guy you're marrying well?   Answer: No, he's a miserable wife beating, insensitive lout...it's just the money.           7. When you get woken up at midnight by a phone call...   Stupid Question: Sorry. Were you sleeping?   Answer: No. I was doing research on whether the Zulu tribes in  Africa  marry or not.And you thought I was sleeping.... You dumb witted moron.&nbsp;           8.

There is very little set up at that address as of yet, but with the help of Boy I am someday soon going to be gradually moving my archives over to the new domain name and making it all pretty and adding all sorts of crap. Yes sir.      Today I had the day off from my Incredibly!Taxing!Job and therefore did very little. Mailed off the 30 Seconds To Mars cd, where the woman at the post office laughed at me because I clearly had  no  idea how to insure a package. Had an appointment with job people, aka The People Who Got Me This Stupid Job In The First Place (TPWGMTSJITFP), who were suitably appalled when I disclosed how I spent my Tuesday at work:  cleaning makeup . Oh yes. My boss is going on a photo shoot next week and therefore I spent two hours emptying two gigundor duffel bags full of Ziploc bags of makeup and wiping down each individual piece, along with sharpening all the dull eye and lip pencils. Also: She wasn't there all day, so I couldn't ask her whether or not this was really part of my job description. Also also: I cut my thumb on a pencil sharpener. Worker's comp! The reason that I am not boilingly angry about this anymore is because I continue to get calls from temp agencies; got one again today, and something will eventually happen with one of those if nothing else, right? It has to, right?     It has to.       There is so much of my self-worth tied up in whether or not I am working. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who's ever gone on a drinking binge because I hate my job; however, I am  also  sure that I am the only person who has allowed that reason that things are wrong to spiral into Everything Is The Reason and end up crying drunkenly in a bathroom about how ugly I am (you will note that this has nothing to do with working). Part of me is shocked that Boy puts up with any of it.      I also have a new obsession that I am slightly worried about:  urlLink guacamole-flavored Doritos . They don't...quite...taste like guacamole, yet I keep eating them as if I can find out what exactly they do taste like. I tend to justify junk-food binges by treating them as if they were meals. I also have in the past claimed that Doritos are, like, a totally healthy junk food because they're low calorie ish and lower fat than other chips. Also, the fifth ingredient per the bag is MSG. Sweet.        So what did we learn from today/resolve for the future?       1. If I find out tomorrow that I do not get this temp job, either, I  will not cry.       2. I should go to the gym more often than I do. Because I'm totally fat.      3.I was kidding about #2.      4. I should also be thankful for every second that I am not cleansing other people's makeup collections and --ghaa--touching their stray hairs. I should also thank the people who make my non-makeup-cleansing time bearable more often.      listening to: Bright Eyes, 'You Will...'             //end//                  \",\n",

We are not a mass marketer.' - McDonald's  'They are spending about the same money and getting three times the lift.' - Banc of America analyst  'The Internet has shaken off the effects of the bursting of the dot-com bubble and now is rapidly coming of age as an advertising medium.

I'm looking into it right now, and I might be disabling my backBlog account if this works out the way I'm hoping it does. Template madifications to come soon.  This is the year of  urlLink Google , for me at least. I've been addicted to the search engine more or less since it's launch. Then there are the  urlLink Image Search ,  urlLink Groups Search  (USENET/Newsgroups),  urlLink Calculator  and  urlLink many other features  that I've been using heavily.  urlLink Froogle  launched and it's better than  urlLink Pricewatch  to find computer stuff and is excellent for finding ANYTHING for sale on the net.  When looking for  almost  ANYTHING, it's now up to Google to give me my answers; I'm waiting for a  urlLink BabelFish  like translator. Google does have  urlLink Language Tools , however they are not up to the power of the 3rd-party powered BabelFish. Actually, I'm looking for a  urlLink Firefox   urlLink Extension  that will do this on the fly.  Then there came  urlLink Orkut , a social networking service that is available by invitation only. I'm now a member, so look me up! There are a good number of exciting people on Orkut and I'm starting to make my rounds in meeting people after lurking for a few weeks.  Now there's  urlLink Gmail , Google's answer to e-mail with 1,000MB of storage space and a rather cool interface, though it is a tad slow on the GPRS for all the JavaScript to load up. Still, I can get to my Inbox faster than through  urlLink Yahoo!  or  urlLink Hotmail/MSN . The  urlLink Adelphia webmail  interface is still by far the fastest for loading. Yet none of them come close to the online storage capacity or the Googlely search capabilities.  If I weren't broke, I might actually try to get into the upcoming Google  IPO . I don't know a damned thing about the stock market (something I would like to change) but I haven't desired pre-IPO stock like this since RedHat applied for it's IPO. It was depressing for those of us who spent all day at work watching the real-time tickers as RedHat climbed and climbed and climbed. A lot of market analysts see this as being a 'Bubble Era'-styled IPO, seeing as how Google is now more than a tech company - it's a social phenomenon - not even in the sense of a fad, but more so in the sense that it's here to stay and continues to innovate and renovate the way that we experience the Interweb.   Note: To those waiting for a picture of the smile, you'll have to wait until I get back to broadband. Hopefully that is this week, but I don't know.

It's pretty wild being able to see 3 fireworks shows going on in 3 cities when you'reup on this hill - and hear them all too ;)  I have no idea how long before some serious changes are seen, but I welcome the changes to this still-torn-from-Communist-Russia country. One big change will be the duty-free zone that is created in the EU. Maybe now my 16oz peanut butter from  urlLink Tesco  won't cost about $5. *g* But seriously, that will help bring in a lot more to help Hungary regain some of the prestige it held during the pre-World War era.  This also means the eradication of the 25% VAT on all-things electronic from EU nations (though it might be totally eradicated, I'm not sure) - so computers will finally come down in price.

I've never had experience in Procurement, SAP, or anything else related to this side of the contracting table. At the same time, there are a lot of things I fear or am worried about or downright dislike. It may be  urlLink IBM  or it could be the German and Hungarian management or the US government, but whatever it is, I don't like it. So here it is, in the best I can give:   The Good  I'm completely happy to be employed again. I'm thrilled to be IBM employed. It's also a very interesting job, even if it is recieving a Req from an internal IBMer and creating a Purchase Order (PO) out of it and then pretty much tracking the PO and future invoice from the supplier and working any issues out with the supplier, requestor, Accounts Payable, etc. But I'm still in training, so it may not be all that glorious in the future; it might just be being a newbie.  The people I'll be working with all seem to be pretty nice. Some might be brown-nosers or pretentious, but generally nice none the less.   I seem to be hitting it off with upper management. One, a Britan, is exceptionally happy to have an ex-techie working in procurement - finding that I might be extremely useful in the UK Products team since I'd actually be familiar with the things we'd be resposible for (hardware, software, etc). Very friendly guy and one of the smoothest talkers I've ever met. In general, I think I'm the only American in the office, so standing out is pretty easy.  Also, after SAP training this coming week, I will be spending 2 weeks in North Harbor, UK for additional training for the UK Maritime Ops group.    The Bad  English is the offical internal language of the company. Yet, as seen in my Lotus Notes 'training' (Notes 6 is more-or-less the same from Notes 4, which I have run) on Thursday, classes are run entirely in Hungarian. Now, with the aforementioned Notes, this isn't an issue since I'm already familiar with the software. The one running the training was the lead IT person for IBM Hungary - quite proficient in English (as are everyone that works at IBM Hungary), yet the lesson was in Hungarian and the instrctor refused to change to English. However, upon finding out (more in a passing comment - I wasn't really complaining by this time), my manager had quite an issue with it. I don't know how far it'll go, but seriously, standards need to be adhered to. Everyone is capable of speaking English. Non-Hungarian speakers are present within the location (I'm not the only one!), yet these people refuse to speak it.  No one seems to know what is going on. Looking at the training schedule, I don't think we've followed it once. Hell, if it weren't for 5 of the 7 memebers of the incoming group going to France on Monday, we would have been let go 2 minutes after returning from the unscheduled 1.5 hour lunch we had on Friday. This seems to be the norm for everything in the office (not knowing what's going on, not following schedules).. at least from the first impressions.

Her music ranges from slow paced piano/strings tunes such as  LOVE ~Destiny~  to high-paced and fun songs like  Independant+ .  Needless to say, Ayumi might be that key that actually started to define a genre of music that I prefer:  Japanese  (aka JPop/JRock/J [insert genre here] ). As Brad, Rob, Jason and others have stated, I have no musical taste. I think, after all this time, that is changing - since Japanese is classified (in the US sense) as JPop for genre - just like Hip-Hop, R&B and Rap genres are in the  Black Music  genre in Europe. Either that or my entire outlook on music is changing - from caring about the lyrics to enjoying the actual music for what it is - music. I can't understand Ayumi (yet - give me 10 years and we'll see how different that is) - but the sound of her voice and the sound of her music is so captivating for me.  Since being introduced to Ayumi, I've expanded to  urlLink Baby VOX ,  BoA ,  The Pillows ,  Do As Infinity ,  Gackt ,  L'Arc-en-Ciel  and many many  many  more... however I still find an obsession in Ayumi's voice and music. I can listen to her for hours on end without ever getting bored with it - ala The Cranberries back in my mid- and late-teens.  The purpose for this post? I was able to snag a copy of her Rainbow album! It's the simple things that make me happy. ^.^   Note: also felt like posting something happy before going to the dentist again for Round 2                        \",\n",

       " \"                           Anywhere but backwards -- something I can achieve!   In all seriousness though, I'm at that point of figuring out where I want to go or more specifically, where I want to be. So I'm just throwing my thoughts out there. While not someone else's decision it's always helpful to get feedback on ideas. Someone who knows me would be able to see me from a different perspective than I can and would be able to critique from that angle.   Life  Marti and I still have no confirmed date for our wedding. This is going to change, we just don't know yet. It will be here in Hungary and and in 2004; I have no doubt of this. Beyond that, everything is up in the air. There won't be any fancy-schmancy wedding, since a courthouse wedding is the only ceremony that would be recognized by the world governments, but there's the needed months-ahead planning for plane tickets for family to be here. For those who are impatiently waiting for a date, trust me, we're going to have a date soon. I promise.  As for where the living of this life is to occur, well, it will be in Hungary for the time being. Specifically, at least until June or July of 2005. When I finally get around to being hired by  urlLink IBM , I will be contractually bound for 1 year of employment. I have been given the recommendation that, if I should choose to attempt to relocate back to the US, I should stay on-board for at least 2 years in that position to 'prove myself'. Marti is in the same situation, however her 1 year period will be up at the end of April 2005 and transfers for her would be roughly the same although there would have to be an employer change from  urlLink Adecco  to  urlLink IBM . We've been assured that this would be a non-issue if all parties involved were accepting.  Another factor will be education. Marti is a test and an oral exam away from finishing her second degree at  urlLink ELTE University . I'm getting ready to start both of mine. I'd like to at least  start  some courses here so that I'm heading in the right direction. While I have no intention at this time to persue a full-length university career in Hungary, there is the option at both EU universities as well as US universities. Is  urlLink Stanford  or  urlLink Carnegie Mellon  out of my reach? Likely, but there is always a possibility. What about  urlLink Helsinki University of Technology ,  urlLink Institute Ivrea , or  urlLink University of Glasgow ? I have not a clue. Reguardless, I have to try and put forth effort in an establishment that I feel would be a worthwhile investment for the large sum of money. The overall deciding factor will be Marti however. She's up for London and I know she'd be keen on Spain as well and the US is  always  the choice of wonder.   Language: Hungarian  I know that I  need  to learn Hungarian - now that Marti's 2nd thesis is complete, she can work with me on learning the language. I intend to be able to watch the Formula One races by the time the Grand Prix gets to Hungary on 15 August 2004. While I don't ever plan to be completely fluent in the language, something that is unattainable for the non-native from what I understand, I do intend to be able to hold conversations in most situations, be they talking to Marti's non-English speaking friends or in a business meeting.  There is not only the personal issues with needing to learn the language, but with the plans of going into a human-computer interface [HCI] based field, it could be an invaluable tool in the business world. There are a good number of Hungarian programmers out there. Three open-source projects off the top of my head include  urlLink MPlayer ,  urlLink GPRS Easy Connect  and  urlLink UHU Linux .  I reluctantly list UHU Linux, as I disagree with their bastardization of  urlLink GNU/Debian Linux , however they are an ever-present open-sourced project in Hungary.    Language: Japanese  Almost everyone that I have thusfar talked to about a degree path in Japanese has either been fully supportive or completely shocked. Be that as it may, I am still pushing forward with the idea that I wish to have one of my majors at University be in Japanese. For one, it fits with my interests in Japanese culture. Second, it is one of the most important languages to know in business and -- besides English and German. In an e-mail I got from  urlLink Scott Berkun , he said  'As far as fluency - it's always a plus. Japanese is probably the most valuable second language to know in the tech sector. ... It certainly won't hurt you - and i bet you think about the world in a deeper and broader way, and your ideas reflect it, compared to mono-lingual folks like me :)'  That's definitely some inspiration if I've ever seen it! In the end, I see it as an opportunity to learn something that I have been intrigued by since I first learned what Japan and Japanese was.   Interaction Design  Interaction Design is the newly branded name for the profession of designing human-computer interfaces.  urlLink Bruce Tognazzini , founder of the  urlLink Apple  Human Interface Group,  urlLink put forth a challenge to those in the industry  to finally name and brand themselves as  urlLink Usability Professionals  did a few years ago. Those in the industry  urlLink responded, branding themselves Interaction Designers . Anyway, these are the people that helped, when utilized, design the layout of the software you're using to read this right now. They're the ones who decided the order of 'Yes/No' boxes on dialog boxes should be. They also researched the overall user interaction experience with using a computer. Any way that an individual might act in interfacing with a device, program, or operating system -- these professionals have played key roles. And, after much ado, this is what I want to do with my future. I have been drawn to all aspects of Interaction Design. Methods, philosophies, executions. Part of redesigning the CSS for this blog was part of that want inside me screaming to  do  something. It's been awhile since I've had that feeling.    Software Engineering - Coding  I'm scrapping the whole idea of learning  urlLink PHP  right now. I'm going to go to the basis of almost all programming languages and start from there: C. I want to get a decent base in C before branching out to  urlLink PHP  or  urlLink C#/Mono  or some other language. This is something I plan on putting in with the aforementioned Interaction Design, as I'd like to be able to design interfaces  and  code them.  Overall, I hope you get an idea of what I'm thinking. I'm not asking for whether you think this is a good way to go or not; for the educational goals as the life part is without the need of opinions. But I'm looking for honest critique. Do some of you out there have suggestions for schools that offer HCI or Interface Design courses while also offering at least a Minor in Japanese? Does anyone have any suggestions for teaching oneself C? Books? Websites? I'm open to plenty of suggestions.  But at least I have a better idea of where I'm going than I did during this time last year.

I put the papers back in the box, shut the lid and sat on top of it like I was trying to stop it from ever opening again. I ran to the bog. Felt like I’d swallowed something rotten. I leaned over the toilet breathing in Harpic and heaving, but I couldn’t make it get out of me. I took the spare Yale off the hook and slipped out the house. Walked up through Fortuneswell, scraping the yellow key up the side of every parked car I went past. Started pissing with rain; sheets of it. Me eyes stung but I kept walking, out to the end of the island. Think I had to get to where it happened. All while I was walking there was this weight inside me like something black and wet and dead. I got to the Bill and climbed down onto the big ledge behind Pulpit Rock. I sat with me legs hanging down over the edge. I looked down at the sea and the rocks and the waves, me clothes getting soaked with the spray and the rain. Then me guts come up all hot and sour in a big blurt. I sat there on me own with me jeans covered in sick. Two hundred yards behind me the Pulpit Inn was kicking out. Don’t know when it happened. Can’t get it in time. It’s a mystery. Most things, you can work out when they happened because they’ve got some sort of  sense, because one thing leads to another. Not this. That’s when I started going out wandering. After Mum and Clair had gone to bed I’d let meself out of the house. I’d drift round the island like I was looking for something. I’d walk past all the houses with their front rooms blue like fish-tanks from the light of the telly. But I always ended up at the Bill, back in the same place. I’d stand on the edge of the land looking out to the sea. And nobody knew I was there.          ',\n",

This place makes sense too:  urlLink http://www.radiohead.com                      As some of you may know I only recently got back from holidaying in my summer resort on Tahiti. At least that was where I was supposed to be. Unfortunately, on the way over our flight hit a spot of bad weather, forcing us to make our landing on some un-inhabited island in the Atlantic. It was with trepidation that we set foot on dry land, fearing as we did that the natives might be hostile. Our fears were soon proven justified, as seven passengers and all of the cabin crew were taken away and sacrificed to the native’s foul god. Wearily we continued in darkness, not daring to light a fire for fear of drawing attention to ourselves. One by one the passengers perished, until only my family and I remained. Desperate with hunger, and delirious with first, we finally spotted what looked like civilization through the trees. A holiday house, with 6 bedrooms with en-suite shower and toilet, 2 living rooms, a kitchen so large you could quite happily loose an entire battalion of geologists in, and our own basketball and tennis court to boot.                   What followed was a delightful holiday in the Republic of Ireland, spoiled only by the fact that I wasn’t exactly dressed for such a temperate climate:    urlLink       Brrrrrr...    I think I shall leave it at that, for fear of this turning into another one of those wretched “what I did on my holiday reports” (urrrggghhh, 4 th  year prelims, the memorys, nooooooo…) Any way, I’ll hopefully get more pictures up as soon as I can figure out, or get Gordon to explain to me, how the hell you post more than one picture in a post. Until then it’s:    “Good bye from him”                  “I said it’s a good bye from him…”                   “I’m all alone.”                   “So very alone.”                   “*Sob*”                             Thanks for reading                                                           Stay Beautiful                                                                                     Davus             ',\n",

       " \"                           Holy crap!   That about sums up my reaction to the start of this race! What in bloody hell is going on down there on the track!? First Klien backs off, probably from a slow Da Matta (gearbox issues were picked up over the radio - fixed in pit), but that knocked out 4 racers before turn 2 on lap 1.   Then we've got Alonso, possibly from a tire puncture cause from debris from the first accident. He hit and slid on the wall just before turn 1 - at an estimated 200 mph.  Now we've got Ralf Schumacher possibly unconscious after a massive wreck going in backwards into the wall at the end of turn 13 at 190+ mph. The announcers are speculating it was caused by a tire puncture as well from small bits of the carbonfibre left from either the first crash or from Alonso. They've confirmed that Ralf is alright, but holy crap!  Now Button goes into the garage?! What is up with this race?! Announcers are guessing that Button's engine was getting ready to go. I gotta feel for the guy - he so desperately wants that win. Sato is doing quite well to move up the field after BAR Honda's in-race pit-stops. Sato is one spunky little Japanese racer - lots of power with an angression that could rival Montoya (though not as wreckless)! He's now the only hope that BAR Honda has to bypass Renault in the Constructors - and with him holding the fastest laptime at the moment, he's got a good chance to just that.  Panis is incredibly up there in the top 6 - fighting it out with Sato, so Toyota is holding it's own in this race!   20 Laps Left  Ralf update that he's fine. He's at the Memorial Hospital to get a catscan, has back brusing and a concussion. The race is getting REAL interesting... Schumi leads with Sato in 5th, being only 15 seconds behind - so the top being competitive in the end! w00t w00t!   15 Laps Left  Montoya is black flagged - someone want to explain to me what that is other than the end of Montoya's race? Bad day for them - but at least Ralf is confirmed to be stable.   10 Laps Left  19 seconds back in 3rd place, Sato is looking great! w00t w00t w00t! Truli is close behind and Panis is right up there! Toyota is pulling up for some desperately needed points - man this race is weird! And yes - I'm DAMNED EXCITED ABOUT THIS!   5 Laps Left  More and more interesting - we're down to 8 racers, which means Zsolt Baumgartner IS GOING TO GET A POINT! All of the Hungarian guys are going to go ape shit at the end of this race! According the announcers, it's been 41 Grand Prixs since Minardi has seen a single point, so as long as Zsolt can hold it - he'll be the first Hungarian to earn a point in Formula 1! WTG!   Checkerd Flag  Guess who - Schumi takes the checkerd flag with Rubens right behind him, but Sato snags the 3rd podium position!!!   Rock on Sato! Rock on BAR Honda!                          \",\n",

'Johnny Cash was a guy who was really an American cultural icon,' said longtime Atlanta country music disc jockey Rhubarb Jones.  'What I loved about Johnny Cash is ... Johnny Cash had a great sense of humor -- a very funny guy,' Jones told his listeners on Eagle 106.7 this morning. 'We're not going to mourn his passing, we're going to celebrate his life.'  urlLink  From the Atlanta Journal Constitution    ....'U2's Bono noted, 'Nothing is as macho as Johnny Cash's voice. A real threat you will not find in a 22-year-old. You just won't. You can dress him up in leather pants, you can have him throw his TV out the hotel window. He can roar in front of all manner of white noise, but there's no real threat when you're a teenager, when you're in your 20s or when you're [in your] 30s. The real sh--, or what they say in New Orleans, the other kind of sh--, comes from the perspective of being in the trenches and having been around a while. All the blues guys had it. Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, B.B. King. Johnny Cash has that and the voice of authority for me.'  urlLink  From MTV         '...'All through the Air Force, I was so lonely for those three years,' Cash said during a 1996 interview. 'If I couldn't have sung all those old country songs, I don't think I could have made it.'  Cash launched his career in Memphis, performing on radio station KWEM. He auditioned with Sun Records, ultimately recording the single 'Hey Porter,' which became a hit.  Sun Records also launched the careers of Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis and others.  'Folsom Prison Blues,' went to No.4 on the country charts in 1956, and featured Cash's most famous couplet: 'I shot a man in Reno/ just to watch him die.'  Cash recorded theme albums celebrating the railroads and the Old West, and decrying the mistreatment of American Indians.  urlLink  From the Melbourne Herald Sun     '...He recorded more than 1,500 songs and was the youngest person chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame.  Cash won 11 Grammies, including the 1999 Lifetime Achievement Award and the 2002 shared Grammy for Best Country Album.   He had two singles on the country charts for 38 consecutive years, including 25 hits between 1958 and 1960.  He posted over 130 hits on the Billboard Country singles chart.  His daughters Rosanne, Tara, Cindy and Kathy and son John Carter performed with him at one time or another.   Rosanne is a country music singer-songwriter.  Cash was honored with a Kennedy Center Award in December 1996.  According to www.legacyrecords.com, he began his career as an outlaw to the Nashville establishment and came to define country music over the last 40 years.  urlLink  From Rediff-India               \",\n",

After talking and discussing to some of my friends and doing some reading,I get to know some of the techniques...First rule, a topic sentence should tell readers whether the information they are about to read supports the thesis statement directly or supports a key idea in the essay which in turn support the thesis.Second rule,reprtition of key words is an important techniques for gaining coherence because if too much information seems new, a paragraph will be hard to read.To prevent repetitions from becoming dull we can use variations of a key word.         From those two rules, I'll try to connect my ideas briallantly especially in order to bind together text that looks too choppy.Another point that I must remember is by using certains words and phrases signal connections between ideas.

After today's misadventures into  CSS  coding, I've learned that this is all so true -- there just aren't enough waking hours to do everything you want to do! But it's fun as all get out. I completely enjoyed myself learning how to throw together CSS code. I also learned how to layout DIVs in a 2 column layout, which isn't as simple as it sounds.

It's cleaner and more streamlined than ever before.  I would like to state for the record that I did borrow some CSS code.

I have given him credit in the code, as seen below:  /* Hyperlink Code  *   * stopdesign base screen style  * author:   douglas bowman  * version:  19 Mar 2004  *   * http://www.stopdesign.com/  *  ---------------------------------------------- */ a:link, a:visited {     border-bottom:1px dotted #69f;     color:#36c;     text-decoration:none;     } a:visited {     border-bottom-color:#969;     color:#9966CC;     } /* wiki class added by Jared Schmidt */ a.wiki {     border-bottom: 1px dotted #393;     color: #393;     title: 'Wiki it!';     } a:hover {     border-bottom:1px solid #f00;     color:#f00;     }  If there is an issue with this and he feels it is classified as CSS Theft, then I will remedy the situation in future code edits. His code is very elegant; his site design also falls under such pleasantries.  I'm still editing the side menu, adding some things that were there and are now gone.

I have found myself very busy with with 2 adventures: Cross-Stitching (including the message board) and my CatMystery board (a moderator, leader of discussion, etc.) I love to read but I find as of late that working with my hands to create a beautiful piece of art work (cross-stitch) is very gratifying. Therefore, once again my historical romance passion is on the back burner on low heat. I'm happy just wish I had more time in the day.          But in a few weeks, my littlest one will be off to school 3 mornings a week. I hope to use that time for sewing, reading, physical activity, house cleaning....Things that are easier to accomplish without her willing fingers. God love her!          I had a wonderful surprise yesterday, Leya (wandeca - hope I remembered correctly) sent me a July in Christmas package - 3 books by Julia London: Beauty Queen, highlander Unbound &amp; Material Girl. The box also included a vanilla candle - yummy, post cards (which I love to mail to people) and a book mark (roses - my tattoo passion). Then I rec'd another book for my CatMystery group - Familiar Series and the beautiful historical cross-stitch.         The cross-stitch is called The Kiss. It would be a beautiful romance novel cover. It shows a lovely lady holding a cascading boutique of roses and the giver is behind her kissing the side of her neck. Romantic! I must figure out how to put pictures on this site, so you may see it. There is a whole series of these cross-stitches, I would love to have them all.         I best be off for now - mornings is my time before Sunshine wakes up. A little time to drink coffee, read, sew or watch the world start it's day.

So I just decided to stockpile/hide the remaining pills for headaches, grab a bunch of strawberries and a Milka bar, find some Dew, and settle in for the onsetting Hell that is massive withdrawl headaches and PMS-like attitude: I'm trying to quit smoking [again].  The first  x  number of times I've tried (it's probably above 10 times over the last 8 years), I've successfully gone above 2 months 3 times, the last being 5 months. If you're not a smoker, or chemically dependant on SOMETHING that is addictive in it's nature, you haven't a clue how dependant you can be on the things - so yes, quitting, reguardless of will to succeed, it tough.  So I'm giving it a shot this time. Do I want to quit? Yes. Will I miss it? Probably. Will the cravings ever go away? According to Loretta, a supervisor from Dobson that I worked with, her husband, who has quit for over 25 years now, still gets the mental craving occassionally. All I can say is: Shit.  Marti's dad, on T-plus 9 hours and counting, has already become dumbfounded. There's usually a shot of vodka involved during the day. During the weeks he works, it's usually after he gets home. Well, no more shots with me, at least for awhile. Alcohol makes me need a smoke - so I'll be 'dry' for awhile too. He's also a heavy smoker, 2 packs or so a day, which is just going to make this even more fun, especially with him smoking inside! Reguardless, I'm going to do this this time. I swear it! (No, I'm not expecting anyone to be excited - I've already let too many hopes down for that to happen - I'm just proclaiming it for personal cheer more than anything).                       \",\n",

This time, he did the root canals first, which I am thankful for as the novacaine was still quite fresh and all numby. 3 more shots of novacaine and it was time to grind the next 2 teeth down to little tiny shafts. This time I knew it was going to hurt like a bitch when the novacaine wore off, as the dentist had to drill away some of my gums.

       " \"                           I'm just moments away from settling down to watch the US Grand Prix on ITV1!   This morning, the Speed Sunday crew were talking with Mario Andretti - the last American Formula 1 racer. After the interview with the lengend I always knew for his Indy career, the group were discussing about the possibility of an American racer, an American team, or even a new track in the US.  On the possibility of the racer, they were discussing that there's a few racers that are in an educational-type program to try to get 1 or 2 American racers into the typically different racing of Formula 1 from the ring-racing we're used to in the States. It would be great to see an American racer, since Andretti stopped racing after the 1979 Formula 1 season.   It'd be even more mind boggling to see an American company jump in - Jordan/Ford doesn't much count as Jordan is the frontline company there and it's European Ford. No one has supporting information that it might happen, but I would love to see Chevy kick into Formula 1 development and racing - or maybe Pontiac, as they have a larger presence in Europe (from what I've seen) than Chevy. Regardless, it could be great PR for the US and a great pickup for possibly getting more Americans into the sport - even in the crowded world of American racing.  On that topic - the CEO of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was interviewed and stated that he would love to see Formula 1 stay there for more time. The reason it's come up is this is the last year of Formula 1's contract with Indianapolis. Both sides wanted to see how much Formula 1 could be picked up in the US, and it seems to have garnered a good response. It took me coming to Hungary to really get into the sport and to appreciate it more and I've just kind of gobbled it up from there. Now, the CEO of Formula 1, in an interview afterward, mentioned that he's commited to 2-5 years more at Indianapolis, but he's also in talks with Manhattan about adding a 2nd circuit in the US. With the schedule crowded already, he said someone would have to go, but there's definitely interest in adding more US courses. I'm sure this has to do with the anti-tobacco laws going in place in Europe, but it should also attract more fans to the sport in the US.                       \",\n",
       " \"                           I've been thinking about beginnings   ...In writing that is.  I watched  Boondock Saints  again last night.  The first time I'd ever seen it was just a couple days ago.  What I love most, is how effortlessly they introduce the characters.  There is no doubt in your mind who they are from the first moment any of them are on the screen.  Even if there are questions about the characters, your first instincts are usually right.  And the hooks are so deeply embedded into the viewer that there is no getting away.    Take the very beginning for instance.  The McManus brothers sit in a pew in the back of a modest catholic cathedral.  They are dressed in black and elaborate tattoos peek out from underneathe their clothes.  Not your typical church goers.  Especially contrasted amongst brightly dressed church folk.  But despite this, most of the congregation seem to react to the brothers as if they belong.  Except for two characters.  One, a little girl on the end of the bench from them, she seems curious, as if she's waiting for them to do something, ...Which they do.  The second character, the preacher speaking from the pulpit at the head of the church, and the only preacher in colored robes, finishes his sermon and begins to sit down.  A second preacher stands up and thanks the first for coming all the way across town from the other side of Boston.  So we now know that he is not accustomed to this parish.  Suddenly the brothers stand up, and walk to the head of the church.  The entire time the regular preacher is giving a sermon, about a young girl that was killed the night before, and that dozens of bystanders watched and did nothing.  You can hear anger and frustration in his voice, but all the while he barely acknowledges the two brothers walking past to the crucifix behind him.  They kneel down to pray.  But the newcomer notices, he starts to stand up, agog at this unusual activity and one of the other parishioners gently places a hand on him to have him sit down.  The viewer is now thinking,  'Huh, so this is a regular thing?'   The new preacher warily sits down again and the regular preacher continues with his words.  As he is finishing, the brothers make their way back out of the church to the door, and turn to listen to his final phrase,  'The only thing worse than Evil... Is when good men are indifferent!'   Accent on the frustration and anger in his words.  The brothers walk out, more tattoos are revealed, they light up their cigarettes and go on their marry way.  The whole scene takes about a minute.  But it so deftly establishes the characters as potential 'Angels of Death' and makes them believable, that you never doubt it for the rest of the movie.  There's dozens more characters, that are introduced just as well.  From the bartender at the Brothers favorite bar, with his stuttering/turret persona, made even funnier by his thick Boston accent and his misunderstanding/misuse of colloquialism, ' Make like a tree and FUCK OFF !'  To the Italian Mob-boss, quietly sitting with a phone to his ear while two other characters berate each other.  Then after nearly 2 minutes of sitting motionless and expressionless he suddenly stands up and is screaming cuss words into the phone and turning red-faced.  Suddenly his is a very imposing character.  Excellent stuff.  I do have a few problems with the movie, despite it now being one of my favorites.  I think it really falls apart at the end.  When Willem Dafoe starts going into drag, and most of the scenes with Billy Connelly at the end, they're cute scenes, but it kinda loses it's believability for me.  But it's still a great movie and I can't recommend it highly enough.  Back to beginnings...  Right now I'm trying to write the opening to my pirate story.  And this is the first time that I've really thought about beginnings in a while.  I've always known it was crucial to hook the readers in just a couple pages, and I always thought I knew how to do it.  And in a way I guess I do, I  know it  but I don't  understand it .  Yet!  In my mind, the key to introducing a character, and a story, is in the way that other characters react to them.  I think about when I'm sitting around a table with a bunch of other friends at Denny's or a coffee shop or something.  Suddenly someone comes in with a new friend, someone that I've never met before.  Of course, there are the descriptors.  Is (s)he cute/competition?  Does (s)he look interesting?  But most of what I learn about this character in the first few encounters is what I gather from other characters/friends.  I'm sort of watching how other people treat this new character.  Are they rolling their eyes, like they think (s)he's a loser?  Are they mouthing jokes without him/her looking?  Or.. Are they all vying for his/her attention?  Everyone is trying to make eye-contact with him/her?  Or are they trying to relate some little quip that renews an instant connection between these two individuals, out of a large group?  Essentially... How do they react?  I've heard this before in writing too, that 90% of character development and 90% of action is in 'Reaction'.  And the formula has always seemed to work for me before.    But I'm starting to notice  how  I go about doing it in my writing.  I've realized I have a tendency to start into a scene  after  the action has happened, so that you are seeing the reaction first.  That way you are engaging the reader even more, because they  want  to figure out what happened to cause this reaction.  This technique has pitfalls though, I find I have to rewrite things several times to make sure that all the necessary clues are in there for the reader to connect the dots.  But it seems to be coming more naturally with practice.  That's how it happened with my comic book art.  When I first started I would have to use twice as many panels to tell the same story.  Because I was trying to draw the  before, during  and  after  of a situation.  The more I did it the more I learned that all I had to draw was the reaction.  What happens the moment after the punch?  And drawing the characters reacting to what was said in the same panel instead of what was said in the last panel.  Tricks like that.  Anyways, I'm starting to see how that happens in writing as well.  So that's my spiel.  I don't know if it helped me to figure out my intro, but I think getting these thoughts out there helps me understand the process better.   --Will                      \",\n",

With   Rika   passing on to become more serverish in her final days, Marti's desktop,   bendy  , has fallen to a case of  Dead Western Digital 30GB Drive  syndrome. Anyone who has bought a 30GB or 80GB  urlLink Western Digital  hard drive in the last 2 years knows, after the fact, that there were a LARGE batch of drives with issues. In some cases, we're talking 5-6 drives a  month  going south. I guess deep down, I knew this would happened eventually to   bendy  . After being a die-hard WD fan for a good number of years, the experience with failing hard drives left me no choice but to abandon WD in the future.  urlLink Maxtor  ($ per GB) and  urlLink Seagate  (near silent @14 decibels) are my hard drive friends now.  The drive is not totally dead yet, but the boot sector is completely  fubar  and I'm now getting errors about uncorrectable sectors (most likely physical damage to the drive platter). Thankfully I have a  urlLink Knoppix  disc so I can dump 20GB or so of files to Marti's laptop and to   Rika  .    UPDATE: It seems the drive is corrupt beyond all repair. All backed up data is confirmed corrupt. The drive itself started the 'Click of Death' in mid-taring. At this point, data loss is now 100% for the drive.    My only issue is that I have to tar everything up because  urlLink Konqueror  doesn't know how to handle the added Latin characters in filenames thus fubaring the network copy. Why can't we just standardize on  UTF-8  or  UTF-16 ?!  urlLink Nautilus  handles this just fine, but that's a  urlLink GNOME  app, which isn't part of the  urlLink KDE -based Knoppix.  Tomorrow the plan is to go shopping. I'm looking at snagging an 80GB-120GB Maxtor (so I can quiet down   bendy  ) and a 256MB stick of PC-133 to try to speed him up a tad, as 256MB is just not enough to run  urlLink XP . The larger hard drive should be the end-all of  'Where can I park my data, since   Rika  's days are numbered?'  issues and space arguments concerning the mp3 collection and it's 22GB of data mass (and growing as I find more CDs around the house to rip).

The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King  was released to theaters today! Needless to say, Marti and I ventured to Hollywood Multiplex at  urlLink Duna Plaza  to catch the 1:30pm show - English with Hungarian subtitles. I won't give details, nor spoilers (for those who have not yet seen it), but see it. It pulls at your every emotion - happiness, saddness, confusion, anger, compassion. I loved it! The battle scenes top those in LotR:Two Towers - and the story is still held together top-notch! It is not for those who are looking for a quick movie, as this one totals 201 minutes (according to  urlLink PestiEst ). This is definitely one movie you will want to catch on the big screen - and to add to your home collection once released in the uber-super-duper ultimate director's cut edition.  I'll not spout the general 'it doesn't follow the book' things that are around the Internet. I haven't read the books. I'm sorry. I plan on it, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. A movie can not possibly contain all of the details that a book has, and keep it under 10+ hours. It will not happen. So please, enjoy the movie as it is - it's an excellent piece of film work! There are many horrendous book-to-movie conversions out there: I give you George Orwell's  1984 . A recent read for me (I'm finally getting around to my list of need-to-read books); I also own  urlLink Michael Radford 's  urlLink Nineteen Eighty-Four  - a rather horrible adaption of the book. Not only are serious character reflections removed, but even little things are changed. The term 'comrad' is replaced with 'brother', giving a slightly different feel to Big Brother's Oceania. This change is obviously from the opions of American society at the time - comrad was a term that was too Russian/communist in 1984, when the movie was produced and released, and wasn't acceptable. It'd be interesting to see how a remake would appear if made today. Then again, I'm interested in seeing how  Memoirs of a Geisha  will be adapted to film (if someone ever picks it up again).    Geek Toy Week   This is a week for the geek. MacWorld kicked off, with Steve Jobs introducing the much rumored  urlLink iPod Mini  during his famed keynote speech. And now, at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Sony announced it's anti-iPod capaign:  the Sony Hi-MD  platform - a 1GB version of it's popular MiniDisc line. Not only can you now put an estimated 45 hours of ATRAC3 music (a hgihly compressed, very high-quality algorythm), and backward compatible with the older MD media standard, but you can also now use the Hi-MD players as external USB hard drives! This has been a long-sought-after feature for MiniDisc, and it's nice to see Sony finally catering to their customers. The players are to be released in April with the basic player having a price tag below $200. Blank Hi-MD media is expected to be $7 a disc. According to some Neowinians, the Sony Hi-MD will actually be more cost effective than the iPod Mini, which is a good move for Sony to recapture some of it's lost market share.  The full Hi-MD specification is available  urlLink in PDF , while a few  urlLink pictures  and  urlLink details  have surfaced in the news.  This is going on my  must have  list. While I like the iPod, I've always taken to MiniDisc, even way back in 1992 when the platform was released. This advance in the format, once again making it viable against other portable media players out there, is enough for me to want it more than anything else out on the market. Good move Sony!

While checking the cast list of  urlLink Ladybugs , since it was playing on  urlLink RTL Klub  just a moment ago, I found something disturbing.  urlLink Jonathan Brandis , of SeaQuest DSV fame, is dead, commiting suicide November 12 2003. While he was a teenie bopper, he showed a lot of potential and it's quite disappointing to find out this news, even if it's 2 months after the fact.  I've been told by Marti that my blogs are too long. Does it matter if I ramble on for a few good lines every evening about whatever is going on in the world, be it personal, news worthy, or geeky? I don't think so. And for all I know, not many will actually read this. But in my absence from the States, all that conversation time goes by the by, and this is my primary outlet for talking. So, if some of you feel these posts are just too long, I am sorry. I like to talk. :smile:                       \",\n",
       " \"                           It's been a big weekend for racing, football and sport in general. We saw the kickoff of the Le Mans 24 hour, which has just ended as I write this. We also had the kickoff of the UEFA Euro 2004 with Portugaul v. Greece (1-2) and Spain v. Russia (1-0). Today we've got the Canadian GP and then England v. France almost immediately afterwards. Then there's the England v. New Zealand test cricket match 4 going on at the moment. I understand NOTHING of this game other than you have to break the 'wicket' with the ball - I have a morning taxi driver to thank for this information. There is also a tennis championship going on somewhere. Now, between the Le Mans and the Canadian GP, ITV1 is showing a motorcyle race. Jim would be happy to see all the Ducatti 998 and 999 series bikes racing (too bad a Honda is leading the race atm [update: and won]). So it's pretty busy in the sport world.  The Le Mans is a VERY interesting race. It's 24 hours, obviously, with 48 cars coming to about 377 laps of an 8.6 mile track - but it's based on time not laps, which is very different from typical racing. To be qualified for a position in the end, you need to complete a certain amount of laps and the driver must complete at least 70% of the time driving. Stressful, I'm sure, is an understatement.  There are 3 classes of cars racing at the same time: Prototype, GTS (modified sports car) and GS. There were 2 odd-ball cars in the race: 1 being powered by diesel (was pulled out over a gearbox problem) and a Ethenol Bio (vegitable oil derivitive) powered car which managed to finish. It's pretty cool to see some alternative fuel sources being competitive. Kinda gives that whole idea that it CAN be done. If a prototype car can maintain speeds of up to 200mph for over 3,000 miles in a 24 hour period, it should be completley possible to do it fulltime in a commercially available vehicle.  Audi took all 3 podium positions, the winner being Team Goh Audi R8, an all Japanese team (the announcers kept putting emphesis on this). In the GTS class, Corvettes lead the pack [GO CHEVY!], taking 1st (Oliver Gavon) and 2nd. It's also worth mentioning that Rally racer Colin McRae was amongst the drivers. I don't know very much of racing outside of NASCAR and Formula 1, but this was one impressive race.  Today's Formula 1 Canadian GP is looking to be one hell of a race. I watched the qualifiers last night, and Ferrari was dominated with Shumi and Rubens sitting in P6 and P7. The Williams BMW team is still bickering amongst eachother over Montoya's crash into Ralf Schumacher in the first turn of the first lap at Nurbering, but now they've got more bickering as Ralf has taken the Pole while Montoya sits in P3.  BAR Honda had good and bad: Button had pole until Ralf (last driver) took it away by 0.066 seconds and now sits in P2. Button's lap was executed perfectly, bypassing Shumi by a whole second (Schumi had pole at the time). Later, Sato was 2 turns away from possibly being able to overtake Button as the 2nd time position had him being faster than Button, but spun out just shy of the line. He was able to recover from the 360 and still pulled in P17, ahead of the Minardi club, but it's going to be a miracle to see him pull up into the top 8 if his engine doesn't blow on him. I'm pretty much a fulltime supporter of BAR Honda now, though I'm still rooting for Toyota as well, so all I can say right now is  'GO BUTTON! .  I won't go into heavy deatil with the other sports events because 1) this is getting long, 2) I don't understand the sports (Soccer, a little, but Cricket?!) and 3) I don't have that much interest in those sports. Enough to watch, but not enough to make comments on them ;)  Take care folks! I'll be back with more later this week as things progress.                        \",\n",
       " \"                           It's been almost 2 weeks.  In 2 weeks, we've gone from snow to mid-50's temps to a thunderstorm+snow/sleet (thunder-snow-storms are :cool:) to highs of 16F with 100+ kmph winds to more snow. Talk about funky arsed weather - there's nothing weirder than seeing the snow 'falling up' - the wind being so strong that it was going upwards, rather than falling! Dave - I'm jealous of those 70's that CNN showed L.A. was getting!  So it's been a screwy week, just like the weather, in the telecommunications world.  urlLink AT&T Wireless , the United States' 3rd largest cellular carrier, put itself up for sale. Yesterday was the final day for bids, with possibilities coming from  urlLink Vodafone  and  urlLink Cingular Wireless .  urlLink NTT DoCoMo , Japan's largest wireless carrier and shareholder of 16% of AT&T Wireless already, decided last night NOT to bid for the American company, citing that they lacked the staff or bulk to realistically acquire and operate a company as large as AT&T Wireless. Check out  urlLink this Reuters article  for a little more detail. I think it'd be interesting to see Vodafone come out on top of this one, considering Vodafone is already a controlling shareholder of Verizon Wireless, having a 55% stake in that company, which it might announce a takeover bid for. Imagine - Europe's largest wireless provider becoming the largest wireless provider in the US as well. 'The Red Coats are coming!'  Another interesting news item is the  urlLink $66 billion Comcast bid to buy Disney . While I'm not one for massive media companies - and the 2 created so far have kind flopped in financial performance against what they promised (AOL Time Warner, Vivendi Universal) - I think this move might be good if Comcast can pull it off. There's speculation - but with Comcast seizing controll, we might see the return of Walt Disney's son to the Board of Directors - as well as the possible joining of forces with Pixar again (after Steve Jobs and Michael Eisner had their disagreement and Pixar broke off from doing any more Disney movies) - heck, Steve Jobs could even take that Board of Directors position that was offered to him earlier, were it re-offered (how cool would that be!?). Granted, there's the whole thing with the distribution channels (Disney owns 2 Satellite Cable providers, but I don't remember who) - the though of Comcast controlling satellite and the possible rise in costs are scaring people already. But this could be a good thing - as the current owners (Eisner and Co) are running Disney into the ground.  Marti's father turned 60 last weekend. A pretty decent party - lasting well beyond midnight. Unfortunately, after not feeling well - I slept through a good bit of it... I think I passed out on the couch a little after nightfall.  I started playing  urlLink Chrono Trigger  again. This is one of those true classic  urlLink Squaresoft  RPG video games. If you haven't played it - go get a SuperNES and pick up a copy (or go the  urlLink Emu  route). An excellent soundtrack by the excellent  Yasunori Mitsuda [site:  urlLink Japanese  |  urlLink English ] , awesome characters, 14 possible endings and revolutionary graphics and gameplay for the time it was released. I've beaten it a few times, but I still get drawn back to it. I'm about to start climbing Death's Peak, for those curious as to where I am in the game - average party level is 49 right now.

Button holds P4, giving BAR Honda the 2nd row, so great work for the BAR Honda boys! w00t w00t! It's interesting to see teams hold rows. Ferrari has the 1st row, BAR Honda holds the 2nd, and the Williams BMW hold 3rd row. I can't wait to see tomorrow's race.  The announcers were talking about some upcoming announcements that I found interesting to now know. Williams BMW has announced they are looking for drive s . I'm not sure where Montoya is going, but Ralf is to be inducted to Toyota. Toyota will be dropping Da Matta, so next season is going to be Ralf and Oliver Panis.  McLaren gets their new cars this coming week, hoping to eek an extra 0.5 seconds out of their team. Williams BMW is introducing a slew of updates to their cars next week as well.

But I must remain vigilant that I do not slip back into my old patterns.  I had become so adept at fixing other peoples problems, and planning/dreaming about the future, that I often forget to live my own life.

I'm not sure what caused the left hinge to be so damned tight, but I think the Unisys guy who replaced the LCD back in 2001 tightend it too much. I've taken the laptop apart 4 times since then (replace keyboard, replace fan on right side (x2), and once to clean) and each time I could not for the life of me loosen it up - even with cloth-wiped-on WD40 or vasoline. So, that stress caused the display bezels (both top and bottom) to crack, and now those cracks have caused peices to come off. I have the entire 'Dell Latitude' logo on the bottom right in 1 removeable piece. I guess I  won't  be selling this thing, and just running it into the ground until it lives no more.   Heat seems to be a major problem now. I burned my fingers on the RAM cover. Fun fun.   Replacement is probably a month or so away.  *begs the IRS for his tax return*                        \",\n",
       " \"                           Not to take no for an answer for free Internet access today, I did my first actual WarWalk today. Using the IBM ThinkPad T23 running Windows 2000 SP4 I've been supplied with for the machine, my trusty NetGear MA401 802.11B PCMCIA NIC and Network Stumbler 0.40 I managed to find 24 APs in the area - 12 insecure, 12 secure via WEP.  I was actually shocked to see one from BTOpenzone, a commercial hotspot WISP run by British Telecom. They don't accept AmEx, otherwise I would have probably hopped on while waiting in a Burger King for the rain to stop. But it's nice to know that WISPs actually exist and run, even if they are run by the bigtime telecoms. Good to know there's a market for them.  This WarWalk actually gave an interesting look at things for me. 4 of the 24 APs I hit were using the default SSID (1 D-Link, 1 Belkin, 2 2Wire) - 2 were secured using WEP.  That lone insecure Belkin was found walking along the sidewalk of a residential building near a bench, so if it's not raining, I might have some good luck with snagging an IP address. The signal/noise was -67dBm, which should be plenty good enough to maintain a 2Mbps connection.  There is a rather large area WLAN at the square near the Universiry of Portsmouth and the library that carries the SSID of mycloud. I ended up bouncing off of 4 of their APs in a 3 minute time frame. From what I could tell from walking around the University is that it is not run by them, so it might be another WISP like BTOpenzone or one of the gazillion businesses there, but whatever it is, it's BIG. All of them connected with signal/noise greater than -80dBm the instant I picked them up, so I should be able to at least get an IP from them and sustain 2-6Mbps as they were not encrypted.  Overall, today was an interesting day that I wish I could've gotten some pictures in, but it was a very dreary and rainy day for the most part. It's cleared up now, but I'm just too damned sore right now to go out. Also the pubs were getting quite busy as the Portugal v. Greece game stars soon to kickoff the UEFA Euro 2004 Football [Soccer] Championship, with Spain v. Russia at 19.25 tonight. Tomorrow will be interesting with the England v. France game.

I'm not dealing with this 40C weather with no fans or A/C or even enough openable windows (the skylights lack screens, so can't open due to bugs). So the problem will be solved. Yay!  *computers rejoice from sound of normal operating temperatures*   Talked to  urlLink Chris  a good bit this weekend - which was cool since I'm not usually online during the week right now. Heard from Dave today too! He lives! *cheer*   Off to sweaty bed I go. Need to try to get some form of rest for  urlLink work  tomorrow.                        \",\n",
       " \"                           So I actually decided to check my  urlLink My Yahoo!  page [account required to customize] and saw some actually shocking news. Here's some of the more interesting ones that stood out.   Opera says 'Goodbye'  Now, I'm not the largest opera fan out there, in fact I know very little opera at all, but there is one person in opera who I respect for his incredible talent:  urlLink Luciano Pavarotti . And yesterday, after a performance of Giacomo Puccini's 'Tosca' at  urlLink the Met , Luciano Pavarotti retired from the stage and opera. I think the article explains it all, so I mustn't ramble on here, only saying, he will be missed.  Article available  urlLink here .    eBay is made of... people!  Not really, but someone in Taiwan tried to break the rules on March 2nd, with an auction of what appeared, with the very rough description, to be 3 women! For a lowsy US$5400! Now, eBay rules state that you cannot auction humans - be they alive and dead, and after they caught wind from groups around the world, removed the auction a few days ago. What is with people these days - don't they know that the sale of humans and/or slavery (in the Western world anyway) is so 19th century? People have better things to spend their money on - military weapons and vehicles, non-military grade weapons, plans for weapons, and  urlLink Microsoft Flight Simulator .

Speaking of catching up to the 21st centruy, the Associated Press is reporting that China, the leader in 'Big Brother'-ism, amended its constitution to take 'steps toward a more capitalist society...amending its constitution to protect private property rights and formalizing a former president's once-unthinkable legacy — inviting entrepreneurs to join the Communist Party.' The first thought that hit me was 'Wow!' This is a change for China, but rightfuly so - this will attract more business to China and will help in opening the country for economic development, which is needed in practically the entire country away from the coastline.  Another part of the amendments that were brought to the constituion was the first-ever mention of human rights. From the article:  'These amendments will help build a sound legal foundation for developing the country,' said Wang Xiujun, a delegate from eastern China's Shandong Province. 'They help clarify the rights and duties of the public.'  Delegates also endorsed a constitutional guarantee on human rights, though it was ambiguous and did not mention political freedom. 'The state respects and preserves human rights,' it said, mirroring statements by the government in recent years.  While there's still a lot of catching up to do, in Western civilization's eye, this is a good step in the right direction for China. It will be interesting to see how these amendments affect China in the next few years.  Article available  urlLink here .                         \",\n",

       " \"                           So I decided that it's time to fix my teeth. Partitally because of the massive amount of sharp pain one of my wisdom teeth was causing. So, as of today, I've now had 2 wisdom teeth pulled, will have 1 more pulled Friday and then begin the extensive work required to fix my other teeth.  Starting next week, I'll be at the dentist every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until mid-May. Work will include scraping and whatever else is necessary for caps. When all is said and done, I'll have 14-16 teeth capped in porcelain. It'll cost $100-$150 per tooth. Considering I'm without dental coverage, the price is phenominal.

       " \"                           So I had my interview with Pál today. I think it went quite well - he seems to be fond of my technical abilities and thinks I would have a rather easy time picking up the systems required to do the job ( urlLink SAP , CAAPS, and of course  urlLink Lotus Notes ) - so do I. He also covered that exact deatils of the job - 'req2acq' as it seems to be called, meaning from requisition to acquisition - covering processing requests, contacting suppliers, making sure it's shipped in a timely manner, the supplies are recieved in a timely manner, handing money issues over to Accounts Payable and making sure the suppliers are paid, and covering any support issues that might come up during the course of the process.   I got a view of the larger picture of the new office in Hungary as well. IBM had 12 centers globally handling procurement for the organization and it's clients. That number will be reduced to 3 - Hungary will support Europe and Latin America; India will support India, the Middle East, Africa, and the United States; China will support all of Asia-Pacific. The reason there is a 'if you terminate early, you must pay back part of the training (to the sum of 3,000,000Ft)' clause in the contract (term: 1 year) is because they want to insure that during their projected time of transition, that their trained staff does not leave them with just more people to train, and delay the time of transition. In all honesty, I have no issue with this what-so-ever. Part of the reason training costs so much is location. 90% of the group hired in January for the Latin American department just returned from their initial training... in Brazil. Training for me and Marti will be conducted either in Hungary or somewhere in the UK. Pál explained the long term goal is to have the transition period over the course of the next year and be completed by January 2005, afterwards optimization and further structure enhancements would begin to tweak the offices.  Part of this, for me at least (since I'm a foreigner), will entail some interesting loopholes, should they hire me. Since I do not have a work permit in Hungary, I'm kind of screwed for employment. For me to get a work permit would require a submission from the future employeer to the government and  2 months  processing time. So Adecco Hungary is going to try a loophole, and temporarily hire me through Adecco Italy, Adecco Austria, Adecco [insert country here], or an IBM office or client that could bring me on. Once successful, then IBM will process the paperwork on my temp hire date, and in 2 months time, bring me on as a full-and-true IBM employee versus being outsourced by Adecco. This excites me to no end!  While talking with Pál, I also brought up medical coverage, as I've been uncovered since my termination with Dobson in the beginning of July 2003. He's going to look into this, but he thinks that once I'm employeed within Hungary, that all medical claims and coverage should be fully handled by the Hungarian government, should the need arise. This is good news, and I hope something like this comes along. I need to research the matter more myself.  Since I'd be here for a year at least, I'm now looking deeper into at least trying to take a course or two at  urlLink Central European University  or  urlLink ELTE University . If I can take something - ANYTHING - it'd be better than nothing. Not like working wouldn't be enough, but I might as well try to start my schooling somewhere, right?  Of course - all of this is hypothetical until I get an offer, but Adecco/IBM should be contacting me before the end of the week.  *crosses fingers* .                        \",\n",

       " \"                           So here I am in the hotel. And I've been watching BBC. I watched former President Ronald Reagan's funeral. I watched the eulogies given by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, former President George Bush and President 'dubya'. And I can't help but feel an absolute sense of home sickness.  I was born during the final months of the Carter presidency, thus spending my first 8 years under the Reagan administration. I can't say that I knew much, or anything, about politics, but I can say that I admired the country that he shaped for me to grow up in. As I grew older and started understanding politics more, I could say that I thought, and still do think, that he is and probably will be the greatest president that will be in office in my lifetime. There's something about growing up in the Reagan era that has given me a sort of optimistic outlook on things in the world. Maybe it's because I was too young to know the harsh realities of life that I do now, but it seemed back then that everything was, well, happier. The economy was good, so everyone was a tad bit better off than the previous generation. People, it seemed, were motivated in that they could truly do what they put their minds to. The people were who the Executive Branch turned to for answers. The whole concept of less government, more commercial helped make the United States a top contender in many areas, including the economic and scientific arenas.   Growing up, there was always this visual that in some sort of weird way, Reagan and Gorbachov were more friends than enemies. I'll put that to childish innocence, but that ideal was given nonetheless. And in the end, Reagan succeeded in doing what he thought was right with helping to bring about the fall of the U.S.S.R. I look at it now with the mind that he helped create the opporunities that lead to Marti and I meeting. Directly and indirectly, he helped the two of us meet. For that I have to to be thankful.  When I was young, I was an astronomy nut. I remember vividly the day Space Shuttle Challenger exploded. I was 5. I also remember Reagan giving his address to the public. It wasn't exactly something I could entirely grasp but it was something to try to make those who felt saddness, feel better. Something that I know now was one of his greatest strengths. He had that charisma that so many politicians today try to mimic with, usually, complete and utter failure.  I heard it on BBC2 that Congress is now suggesting that Reagan's face be added to Mount Rushmore. I fully support this idea. He was a man who helped not only the United States, but the world, take a step in the right direction.   It is because of Reagan that I started liking the Republican side of politics. I've sinced re-nig'd on that view, but on afterthought, had I been old enough, I would have voted for him.  I'm sorry for the incomprehensible rambling here folks, but I was deeply saddened by his death, watching the motorcade on Wednesday, the viewings on Thursday, and now the funeral today.                       \",\n",
       " '                           So here I am sitting in the hotel room, getting ready for my last full day in the UK. I can’t sleep anymore. I’ve got so many things on my mind that I can never settle to get any rest. I have slept less than 8 hours in the last 3 days, and the entirety of the last 2 weeks has been this way. I guess everything has just been building up.  Being here, pretty much on my own, has led to me missing everything in my life even more now than ever. Yes, I’m here with 3 others, but there is no level that I can connect with them. 3 Hungarian girls, between 25-28, and I swear that on so many levels I am stuck with 15 year old high school girls. I’m finding more and more just how naive they really are. They are people that have never lived on their own; in 2 cases, never had a fulltime job and the responsibilities that come with it. I look at myself and those around me – and it just completely blows my mind away. True, Marti has never lived on her own, but she’s experienced living in the US for 3 months out of a year for over 10 years; an experience that, regardless of country, is life changing and opens your eyes. These girls have neither this experience nor, it seems, the ambition to find it. From what I’ve seen, the girls treat this the same way that most teenagers would treat class: with a half-hearted effort and a half-hearted care.  It’s impossible to strike up a serious conversation with any of them. Politics, economics, art, computers and geeky/nerdy stuff, news… hell, even the weather! Getting 1 sentence out of them is easy. Getting 2 or more is like pulling teeth.  They are just entering life. At 15 I had more experience with “the real world”, or at least had a clue, then they do now. I knew how to build things, how to take care of a garden, how to cook some things – how to take care of myself (except washing clothes – I’m still learning that one). I may not have wanted to do it then, and I may even act like a tard now and not want to do things, but I know how to do them and in some cases enjoy it – or at least knew enough to have a semi-decent conversation.  The simple idea of finding a level with people has gone by the wayside. The 4 of us could be in the IBM cafeteria, and after trying to strike up conversations on ANYTHING, they just go off into their own Hungarian, chitchat, gossipy world. It’s maddening and its driven me to be off on my own, knowing that, while I have to play the team part at work, it will only be a forced thing and it will be me fending for myself whilst the others fend for each other.   And this leads me to where I’m feeling now. I feel lost. I feel lonely. Above all, I miss everyone even more than I ever could have imagined.  I miss Marti. I miss being in Hungary with her. Even with all the things I want to bitch about and think or horrible or ass-backwards, I still miss it. Marti is my life and I can say that it hurts. It’s a different hurt than when I was home in the States because my family existed.  I miss mom and Jess. While the living arrangements were odd at times, I miss being able to hang out with them, just crash on the couch and watch a movie or have dinner together or go out and chill at Champions. We’ve all been through the whole “leaving the nest” thing, but we never moved that far away – and I’m really glad about that because mom and Jess are more than just family, they’re friends and I can actually talk to them about anything. I seriously never thought that would be possible after my asshole teenaged years, but life shocked the hell out of me.  I miss the rest of my family too – all of my friends. Just as mom and Jess are now friends and family, you guys are more family than anything to me. I miss having LAN parties when we could; playing darts with Jason, Dave; the unemployed 2 hour+ phone discussions with Jason about anything-goes geek and then some or the trips to the Apple Store in Tysons Corner because we wanted to oogle what the store had to offer; hanging out at Niso’s; sitting on the hatch of Chris’s truck in the Wal-Mart parking lot at 2:00am; the days/nights of hanging out with Rob and Brad for Trek and South Park or just for the helluva it; the tag-team play through of video games with Brad; Taco Nights with the house filled with a gazillion people, all friends; computer shows every weekend with whoever was game or needed computer parts or fixin’s – and adventure day in itself. It’s not often that you have so many friends that you truly know – I couldn’t count on two hands – and that just helps make life that much enjoyable and easier to go through.  And now I’m realizing that without any of the people that are in my life, without any contact with them since the net and phone situation has been nothing but crap, I am so alone.  The friendships I have, family and pseudo-family alike, are something that could never be replaced. Even being in Hungary and attempting to make friends there, it will never be the same. I’ve known everyone for years. Hell, Chris and I met in 7th grade; I’ve known most of the crew since ’93-’95 from ADS/KIS.Net. I’ve known Niso the shortest and even she’s the greatest old woman friend a 23 year old could have! (sorry Niso – had to =^_^= ).   I can dream about having friends in Hungary. I can dream and it seems that it will stay that way for the time being. Having a “curfew” of 9:30pm to catch the last bus to Fot makes it hard to even go out on “team activities” with work, let alone hanging out with people outside of work. Marti’s friends are exactly that, Marti’s friends. I get along well with them, but I don’t have those ties with them – not to mention a few of them are afraid to talk to me in English for more than 1 sentence or so because OMG It’s my native language!  It’s 1:00am, so I should try to get some sleep or fool myself into thinking I can sleep. I just miss everything and everyone that I have had in my life that are suddenly not there, even though they still are.  To all of you, I miss you and love you.                       ',\n",
       " \"                           So the race in  urlLink Melborne  is finished. And it was heavily Ferrari lead.  urlLink Michael Schumacher  led the race for all 58 laps, with his teammate holding 2nd the entire time.  urlLink Schumi  also broke the all-time lap record, 1:28 something, with his fastest lap being in the low 1:24 area.   urlLink My guys  completed in 1 piece but were blown out of the water, being lapped  twice  by both Ferrari drivers. Panis was having trouble with the new TF104 cars in testing last month, so I guess it's understandable, however da Matta was able to inch into 13th for awhile. I guess time will tell how we'll do in the next race, but I fear this will be another Ferrari year.   I do have to give credit to Schumacher though. He is the all-time champion of Formula 1, having won 6 consecutive seasons. And if Melborne is any indication of how things will proceed, it could very well be 7 by the end of this year.  I'm excited to see how the new  urlLink Chinese Grand Prix  will be. The course is set to give drivers a challenge, with numerous turns (turns 2/3/4 and turns 14/15 anyone?) and a high-speed straight-away.   urlLink Here  is an overview of this past weekend's race from Formula1.com, as well as some  urlLink quotes from the drivers .   Snow?!  So it's snowing again. There is snow from 2 weeks ago, last week, and the snow has started sticking to the parts that have melted away with the 2 days of sunshine we had. The sun actually came out! It's been a good long time since I've seen the sun.   I like snow. I like winter. However, living up on this hill in Fót, it makes it a pain in the arse to get around. The Trabant isn't reliable enough, and even normal cars have a difficult time with the hill when there's snow on it - let alone ice. I don't know the grade of the hill, but it's similar to the grade I-70 has near Sidling Hill in PA, maybe slightly more.   Employment? What's that?  Marti has just been hired by  urlLink IBM Hungary ! The position came through  urlLink Adecco , who is responsible for hiring a majority of the staff of IBM's new office. They're closing down the IBM UK office and moving it to Budapest to save on costs (like most US tech companies are doing, shipping work offshore to India). She'll be working in Procurement, handling the procuring needs of all IBM offices in Europe.   Well, I got a call from  urlLink Adecco  for the initial interview with them. They'd like to bring me on doing the same thing too! The good part about these positions, is that the offical internal language of IBM is English, so all communication, documentation, and such are in English. The impression I got from the woman at  urlLink Adecco , Olivia, was along the lines of  'You're a native English speaker?! I want to hire you right now, but we have to go through the formalities.   I have an interview with Pál (in English: Paul), the IBM Manager/Director guy that will be head of the department here. Olivia confirmed that if I took the job, I would get the requested 250,000Ft/month salary (I'm not greedy! I'm American! -or something like that). I'd have to sign a 1 year contract, but I'm willing to do it. I'd still have 20 days of vacation, so a visit back the the States is quite doable! The best part though:  urlLink Adecco  would be doing all of the paperwork for me to have a Work Permit here!  I would be starting the CompSci/Japanese schooling in the Fall of 2005 if/when I sign the contract. Here's hoping for Wednesday to go well!   Tax Happy Hungarians  So I started looking deeply into expenses and how money is handled in Hungary, with the prospect of actually having an income.  First, as I stated earlier, the average Hungarian makes between 100,000Ft and 150,000Ft gross. To figure out your net, take about 40% for taxes. Taking the high end of the average, that would leave one with about 90,000Ft. For Marti to get to Budapest, a monthly Volanbusz bus pass will cost 7,000Ft/month and a monthly Budapest Transit System pass, which covers the blue city buses, metro system, above-ground tram system, and short-distance trains (they're green on the transit maps), it will cost another 5,000Ft/month.  Her cellphone bill has a base of 3,500Ft/month. Off-peak phone calls cost 35Ft/min to PannonGSM customers, 45Ft/min to Westel customers, and 55Ft/min to Vodafone customers. Peak hour calls are about double. SMS messages cost 15Ft/message, 25Ft/message, and 35Ft/message respectively. Long-distance charges are added on top of these. Sending international SMS messages also have addition charges. So needless to say, just owning a phone can cost a lot. The average phone bill has been around 6,000Ft/month for her phone.  On top of the general phone, there is also a Vodafone GPRS account we have for Internet access. Right now, the plan is a 200MB/month account, which costs 6,500Ft/month. The max plan we can get is 1GB/month, which costs 20,000Ft/month.  There is also the case of a student loan which needs to be paid back at 11,000Ft/month. While higher education is paid for by the government, students can take loans for other expenses. Marti took a loan for a plane ticket to the US one summer.  Without calculating bills (food, natural gas, electric, water, rent, car,etc), I cannot understand how people make it. Take into thought as well, that there are taxes on everything. A DVD generally costs 6,000Ft - 8,000Ft. Many audio CDs are in that range as well. Going to the movies is 1,000Ft/person. Most 'Menüs' (Value Meals) at McDonalds or Burger King are 600Ft+. A bottle of Mountain Dew is 250Ft. Following the exchange rate, which was 205Ft to a Dollar when money was exchanged this past Friday, many of these things are equal or above what they would cost A the US.  This is due to import/duty taxes, media duplication taxes (the RIAA couldn't sue you here, because the government already taxes to compensate studios for illegal copying - on the actual media and on blank media such as CD-Rs, DVD-Rs and tapes), and sales tax. On top of it, there are specialty taxes, such as the electronic-related purchases (computers, TVs, cables, razors, blenders, etc) there's a 25% tax.  I was blind to all the costs before, because I had an American income when I was visiting. With the gross income I made at I/tech, for example, I made (on today's exchange rate) about 718,000Ft/month (on the exchange rate at the time, it was over 1,000,000Ft).   With Marti now having the job, it will help make life easier. And the even easier help will come in the form of me getting a job...                       \",\n",
       " \"                           So, I've been sick for the past week. I neglected e-mail, forums, blogs, and everything else. And I don't even know what it was: either a hard hitting cold that knocked me out, or a light case of the Flu (since the Flu normally puts me to sleep for a few days). Either way, I'm pretty much recovered from it now. Now it's just lots of catching up on news bites and e-mails and everything else that occurs on a normal daily basis.   Laptop fun   ---BEGIN RANT---  So, the Dell has been continuing on it's dying path.    Cause of Death 1  The display flickers a good majority of the time now - enough that it causes headaches after extended use. Then again, it would actually have to power on first! It has started to not resume power when coming out of sleep or hibernate, thus rendering those features almost useless. Never mind that the display was replaced under warrenty in 2002   Cause of Death 2  There's also the issue with my PCMCIA network card, that the system, due to ACPI hell, is now confusing IRQs with both the touchpad and the USB port. Under Windows, it doesn't matter if it is setup as a 'Standard PC' or as an ACPI-enabled PC, it refuses to load the NIC due to resource conflicts. Under Linux, I have a fix for this, and it works, but still pops up occasionally. Needless to say, the 'Designed for Microsoft Windows' sticker that irritates my right wrist is now there for comical reasons. It's time for a new laptop.    Cause of Death 3  The CD-ROM drive continues to go downhill, as it reads CDs less and less often. Playing with it, and threatening it to suffer a similar death a head-burried-in-platter hard drive suffered, it will read, but it's having great difficulty in doing so. Listening to it spin up, and stop, spin up and stop, spin up and stop, spin up and then finally read the disc is annoying. I know the part can be replaced easily, but it's just one more reason to be frustrated with this thing.  So, I'm starting to look at eBay - as I don't want to spend too much (so as to keep funds around for other things, and also since I'm planning on buying a PowerBook in January 2005), but I need something that is better than this dying POS.  ----END RANT----   On the positive side, Linux continues to amaze me. It's been a LONG time since I printed anything under Linux - actually, I don't think I've actually ever printed anything under Linux - but I have printed from HP-UX 10.20 (when I managed the print spools at  urlLink IBA  for  urlLink ADA ). Reguardless, I had to print something for Marti, and while at the office, I snagged the parallel cable for the office's Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 1100. Plugged it into the laptop, popped open the Print Manager, told it I had a printer on  /dev/lpt0 , that it was an HPLJ100, and boom - there's a test page. For configuring a parallel-based printer without a reboot, that was dead-on simple. No drivers to fuss with and a helluva lot simpler than fooling with the printer spool. I'm quite amazed. All in a nice looking GTK2 GUI package.     B  e  Inspired  Not to cut on Siemens' current slogan with their S55 phones, I also managed to snag a copy of BeOs Developers Edition 1.1 to go onto the 6GB hard drive, since Windows is all but useless to me now. If I had my CDs, I'd be using BeOS 5.0 Professional (yes, I'm one of those proud owners). BeOS was one of those operating systems that rocked the socks off anything on the market at the time (AmigaOS repeat anyone?) that just did not have the marketing mass or the capital that grows on trees like some of the other OS developers. Developed in the early '90s, it heralded the era of true multi-tasking kernels (and preemptable as well IIRC), a 64-bit journaling filesystem (BFS), and was a multimedia development environment wet dream come true. After some rather poor corporate decisions, taking Be in the direction of Internet Appliances (creating BeIA in the process and all but abandoning BeOS), Be was liquidated and picked up by Palm for cheap. But BeOS lives on in the hearts of many, is being consrtucted (quite poorly from the numerous reviews) by  urlLink YellowTab  in the form of Zeta, and in the Open Source world in the form of OBOS (OpenBeOS). Just check out  urlLink BeBits ,  urlLink BeOS Online , or  urlLink BeOS Journal  - you'll see how active this small, but quite friendly, community is.  I'll just give the final comment here (for now), that on a Pentium-200MMX with 128MB RAM, BeOS ran circles around and had more capabilities than a PentiumII-266 with 256MB RAM running Windows98, WindowsNT4, Windows2000, or Linux. Both machines had S3 Trio 4MB PCI video cards and the same cheesy Western Digital 3400 Caviar IDE hard drives.

       " \"                           Something has been bothering me the past couple of months in reguards to my computing. Maybe it's because I don't have the unlimited access that I used to have. Maybe it is something to do with maturing that all computer geeks go through. I don't know.  After today's events with   bendy   and all of the tweaking issues with   rika   over the past 5 months, I think I've come to conclusion that doing tweaking is no longer... fun. I find myself looking more and more at pre-built machines, at software that Just Works  TM   and solutions that are there for work to get done; to encourage productivity.   Does this mean that as I find myself increasingly interested in design and graphics that I will become less of a geek in the eyes of my peers simply because I don't want to dick around with things anymore? I still like to tinker, only on a machine that isn't an everyday machine (something I don't have and won't for awhile). I just don't have the desire to sit down and work my way through getting an OS or software to work with hardware or play around and swap hardware around all the time.  Maybe it's because I 'tasted the Apple' (punny?) and it's been slowly infecting me like a virus. Mac people generally aren't tinkerers. They just want it to work and for the most part, if not always, it does. There's a lot to be said for that, especially for a platform that has a smaller footprint than Linux according to recent analysts.  But today has just made me realise that hardware and OS tinkering just isn't something I want to do anymore. I want to be productive. I want to be able to just do whatever it is that I want to do without having to worry about the platform I'm working on outside of the inevitable hardware failure.  Could this be a continuation of when I dropped from 5 functional workstations, 1 laptop and 1 PDA to what now amounts to 1 workstation in the US and a laptop-turned-server-until-she-dies? Was the consolidation more maturity than it was just a want to have some spare cash?  I'm rambling, but really.. have I matured in my way of thinking or am I just becoming less of a geek? I'm at a loss of what to think and since it's difficult to look at one's self to figure this out, I pose the question to you (whoever is reading this).

Never ment for it to happen.   tl;dr:    May 22 - May 30:    - working. a lot. so much that I rarely got on the net when I got home (actually, I don't think I did at all). Mostly work, go home, sleep; repeat. - Confirmed word on May 28th that I would indeed be going to the UK for not 2 weeks but 4 with a return in June 25th. Marti wasn't/isn't happy.    May 31 - June 4:   - Fly Malev Airlines from Hungary to London-Heathrow then catch taxi to Portsmouth, UK. - Begin Procurement training for the Maritime GSP group.  So far the weather has been wonderful. Small bit of rain when we landed at Heathrow (if I'm spelling it wrong, sorry), but nonetheless it's been in the low 20C temps with partly cloudy to clear days. Wonderful.   The hotel, the Travelodge Portsmouth in North End (aka North Harbor) is alright. the bed is comfortable, but that's about it. 4 channels of TV, of which 2 of them are BBC News and a BBC rotating channel that plays CBBC, ITVC, BBC1, BBC2, BBC3, and like 4 other channels. It changes the channel at the end of every program, but some programs are an hour, then off-air for 2 hours, and then back on - so you miss the finale. There's no phoneline and I've now been informed that there isn't much hope in the way of the phone being connected during my stay. No phone means no calls to Marti, no dial-up at the hotel, nothing at all in the way of communication. OK, so it kinda sucks. I really don't think I've been a hotel THIS bad in a good long while and that includes the 5 billion hotels I stayed in while working for  urlLink I\\\\Tech .  Training has been going well. SAP is a MASSIVE system and I'm starting to get over my fears of submitting Purchase Orders. I've done 3 so far this week, more or less on my own - I've had a few questions, but the proceedure is coming along nicely I think. I'm happy that the training is at a fast/intensive pace.  As for the people around here, they're all generally nice. The IBMers are cool people. I plan on hanging out with Cassie (she was in Budapest training Marti's group) and Therese (my trainer) tomorrow after Cassie buys a car. She wants to do a pub crawl around Gunwarf Quays (it's pronounced Keys, I have no idea why) - and I'm in. For £2/pint of Guisness (or cheaper) - it's not all that bad.  So now we're here for today. I'm currently at  urlLink Netc@fé Portsmouth  at £3/hour (£5.50/2hours). And by the way it's looking, I'll be here for a good few more times too. I hate the British layout keyboards, but I do have to give credit to them:  the keyboards, mice, and monitors are all  digital   I will have pictures posted as I can. I forgot to bring the USB cable, so yes, I do suck. I promise though, I will have pictures and I will have more posts. Especially now that I know where some net access is.   Just on a side note: I'm  urlLink stumbling  for hotspots but haven't found any I can use in the vacinity of the hotel. I've found a few out and about, but nowhere near a place I can easily sit and borrow net access on open access points. Hopefully I'll find something somewhere.

       " \"                           There's something inherently different and life changing about living with a geek, at least from a woman's point of view. Or so I've been told anyway - on many occasions. Marti has been a very good example of this. From my perspective, in the past, she used the computer when she had to but not for much more. She knew how to use it, how to use what she needed and that was it. She dealt with whatever she was given and used it, whether she liked it or not, and just accepted it as what there was. This has changed drastically in the past 4-5 years that I've been with her.   GUI  I managed to hit up  urlLink NetCafe  again and got to chat with her for awhile. Part of the discussion led into her talking about one of the things she loves most about Lotus Notes: the tabbed interface. For those who do not know what Lotus Notes is, it is a mail client interface to Lotus Notes/Lotus CC:Mail as well as a database interface, portal interface, and a whole slew of other things. And it works using tabs for everything - a concept not heavily used in most software. She's come to use and love having a tabbed interface!   This love of tabs initally comes from her use of Mozilla Browser and Mozilla Firefox. In the past she didn't much care about the browser - just that it worked. Not having broadband, downloading a 15-20MB file for Netscape Navigator or Mozilla didn't much interest her. When I built her desktop machine 3 years ago, I dumped Netscape Navigator 7 on there - it went unused. When I came over this past September, I had already become a full convert of the 'less is more' concept provided by Firefox and after a nasty IE-based attack, I dumped her onto fulltime use of Firefox whether she liked it or not - she picked it up quickly and soon found the tabbed interface. It all changed after that. Now she is intolerable to IE and it's 'taskbar hell' caused by multiple pages being open! And it's not just Firefox; if I could get GAIM for Windows to be more stable and usable than Trillian, we might have another winner here - because again - she loves the tabbed interface it has!  Now, that may not seem very geeky or elite in itself, but that shows that she is starting to take an interest in exactly  how  she is interfacing with her computer rather than just dealing with whatever is there. She's converted away from IE because of the lack of tabs and the no-popups. Yes, IE's up-and-coming update will include the urgently needed popup blocker - but as far as I'm aware, a tabbed interface is not quite there in Microsoft's sight.   I/O  Those of us who prefer I/O (input/output) that differ from the typical are sometimes looked upon as freaks or weirdos. I myself prefer small-width/short-depression-distance keyboards similar to those found on laptops or Macintosh keyboards of the Apple IIgs type for ADC or the Apple Pro Keyboard for USB/BlueTooth. I prefer finger-driven trackballs - my trusty MS Explorers have served me well, not to mention cutting down on the pain from CTS.  My buds Jason and Brad love their 101-key spring-loaded tactile-feedback keyboards, circa 1982 from IBM - you know - those clickity keyboards that weigh 40lbs. Brad's a 2-button/scrollwheel kinda guy (though he did kind of like the Logitech finger-driven trackball I used at CellularONE); Jason finds comfort with his thumb-driven MS Trackball and the Apple Pro Mouse.   Jason- if you Google enough, you'll find some Mac users who've gotten their AT Keyboards fully functional on a Mac including a software driven Apple key (using 2 combined keys), though it was for MacOS 8.6 on a PMac 8600 - don't know about OS X - wish I still had the link.   Marti initally was, again, using what she had: your typical 104-key keyboard and a 2-button mouse (with or without scrollwheel, I don't remember) and just stuck with it, not wanting to take the time or money to venture outside of the norm. After 1 summer of using my computer, she fell in love with the MS Natural Keyboard Pro and MS Trackball Explorer. So much to the point that, after recieving those as part of her new computer Christmas/birthday present package, she never wants to give up her trackball and can no longer tolerate using a mouse at work! I'm not 100% sure on the keyboard scenario at work, but for home use she wants to retain her Natural Keyboard no matter the cost. Thankfully when we have the money to go Mac, there are non-Apple USB, RF and BlueTooth solutions out there as Apple shows no interest at this time to produce another natural keyboard (though I can say in their defense, even when my CTS would flare up often, an Apple Pro Keyboard did not cause me any pain whatsoever, so the design might be well off enough for not needing to produce one).   So again, Marti has started to care about her computing experience. She's no longer willing to accept just the norm, but has taken to things that make her more comfortable with her computing time. Not to be punny, but she's finally decided to put the personal back into personal computing - between the software she uses and the way she interacts with the computer. She's come to expect certain things and if something is lacking, drops it like a bad habbit. As her life has come to circle more and more around computing, she's learned that she does actually have choices and she's made choices that help her. For that, I can say that I'm very proud of her.                       \",\n",
       " \"                           This has been a tough week. With Peggy, Ronald Reagan and now Ray Charles passing on there hasn't exactly been a lot of joy. It makes you take a step back and think about what you are actually doing with your life. That's very depressing at the moment. I swear I just had this last month!  Things here in the UK are a tad different than the US, but it's probably the closest to the US that you'll get in Europe - for those curious. I guess in a way, we're not all that different afterall, no matter how much people want to think that Americans are evil people who started a war (right now anyway). I could honestly see this as a 'home away from home' place. It's weird because Portsmouth actually gives me a feeling of Endicott and Frederick mixed with a little of the Inner Harbor in Baltimore.   You've got Gunwarf Quays and Southsea where things are built up, wealthier, waterfront properties similar to the way the piers have shot up around Inner Harbor of late.  The area surrounding IBM North Harbour mixes that whole feeling of IBM Endicott with one of the parks that we used to go riding our bikes in Endicott. There's a lake on the property with a walking/bike path around it.  Downtown Portsmouth has that downtown Frederick homely feel to it, with English architecture. Lots of little storelets, family-owned pubs, 2-story rowhouses and slightly thinner roads complete the area.  Northside is a little less attractive, being like some areas of Baltimore or the area around Krugs in Frederick, but it's still a busy place lined with pubs, clubs, and family restaurant/pubs complete with Guiness signs (the UK is the highest consumer of alcohol in the world - everything is a pub around here)!  It's a quaint area, Portsmouth is. But definitely need a scooter, motorcycle or car to get around. Walking no less than a mile to get to Commercial Rd. everyday is a pain. It's at least 0.75 miles up the road to get to the Northside strip where the pubs and other food joints are. A pain to say the least. Yes, it's exercise, but with all the walking I've done in the last 2 weeks, I've got blisters on my feet (wearing both my Nike boots and Vans). Oh well. =^_^=                       \",\n",

The musuem was started ..umm&nbsp; I don't quite remember right now the dates ..oops.. guess I should've been paying closer attention..Well anyways.. I do remember that it is Britains oldest public musuem. It was started by some man named Tradescant, which actually was started after his son journied to America and brought back several things. From then on.. many of his friends would give him collectible items and his son many other journeys and brought back many other things. The items were passed down from generation to generation throught the Tradescant family, however come the third generation the young boy Tradescant, passed at the early age of 14 or 15 which left only a daughter - of course not thinking that a woman could handle such responsibility as of keeping the tradition and items in preservation he gave his collection to a man named Ashmole...&nbsp; TBC&nbsp; luch time   So to continue..&nbsp; Ashmole preserved and continued on the tradition of collection rarities from around the world. Later there was a building created by Asmole because the collection was outgrowing his house, and a second building was then made after the collection outgrew the first one.  Some of the collections are quit similiar to those that you would see in musuems back home, but the jewlery collection was absolutely amazing!!&nbsp; And for all those of you who truly know me... understand that it would have to be absolutely magnificent for me to say something like this. I also found the Egypt section quit interesting. Any of you every think that the 'soul' of these entombed individulas that have been unearthed by archealogist (sp?) get ripped away from their life after death because of not having their body?? I wonder if you could go back into time and ask ancient Egyptians what they thought would happen to an individual if they were unearthed hundreds of years from their death?&nbsp; Would they say that because they have spent so much time in the afterlife they would no longer need their body, organs, and other worldly possessions to continue their life their after??&nbsp; Is this the cause of poor in the world??&nbsp; The untombing of ancient people who were ripped away from their after life w/ no worldly possessions.. to mearly roam the earth of today with nothing?? hmmm...&nbsp; guess all this fresh air is getting to me!!  Anywayss.. enough with all of that..&nbsp; This afternoon I ventured over to the Natural History Musuem  urlLink http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/homepage.htm &nbsp;and Pitt Rivers Musuem  urlLink http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/ . The Natural History Musuems is pretty much identical to those found back in the states. However their is a neat little section about Alice (from Alice in Wonderland) and a really cool replica of the Dodo bird!!  The Pitts River Musuem was formed by a man named Pitts who was interested in how tools were invented and then improved through the years in many cultures. It has been the most interesting section of my ventures so far. He had collected many things from many different countries that all were used for the same purposes, but created totally different... Examples:&nbsp; yarns and different types of materials used by different people from all over, types of beginning canoes and boats and how they transformed over time, examples of how death has been preserved and changed over time (I particularly found fascinating the exhibits on shrunken heads, most of which came from some part of Ecuador. They look so real) there was also many examples of clothing and footwear, cooking utensils, and musical instruments from the beginning to the transformation of what they appear to look now. I think I might venture back over there tomorrow afternoon since it will be a free afternoon.  Well.. the food here is VERY BLAND. Thank god that the cafeteria here has spices set out to flavor the food with. So far I have mostly eaten fish, I have had salmon three times and everytime it has been terrific.. oops I lied they had raw smoked salmon last night for a appetizzer (the texture almost made me lose it!!&nbsp; but the taste was great) I tried some sort of chicken today with couscous (sp?) I thought it was a B-B-Que chicken, but came to find out it was mearly in sweetened tomato juice, so I added many spices and it turned out wonderful.  Well..

I have pictures - I might be able to post them later on.    This is Marti's 2nd degree, her first being in Spanish. Now she needs to figure out what she's going to do with these degrees ;)    For a graduation present to herself, Marti decided to buy a Satin Silver PlayStation2 and GranTurismo 3 A-SPEC! It's 'pretty', Region 2, and hers. And of course, she's already addicted to GranTurismo and she hasn't even gotten into the GT Mode - only the Arcade Mode!    She also got a Sony DSC-P71 digital camera (inherited from her parents), a Sony alarm clock that she fell in love with (it has a 3' diameter snooze button), 2 shirts, a skirt (Yay for summer weather!) and a powered TV antenna so she can clearly watch the local channels that aren't available on the UPC Satellite box.    I am very proud of her achievements. She's worked her ass off for both of her degrees!  Yay Marti!                         \",\n",
       " \"                           Well, I'm still alive after yesterday. My gums hurt like crazy, but it's not AS painful as I thought it would be. I think the most painful point was the 6 shots of novacaine - I hate needles to begin with, and having the novacaine rammed up into your gums and the roof of your mouth is painful.   Work done so far:  - 2 root canals - 2 front teeth ground down to about an eigth of an inch wide shafts for porcelain crown secure points   Work to be finished by Friday:  - 4 root canals - same grinding down treatment in preperation for porcelain crowns  The most disturbing part when the work is being done is, of course, being AWAKE to hear all the nasty things he's doing with wires and that damning drill. Also, the smell of teeth being ground up with a drill smells something nasty and the smell turns to taste once the novacaine wears off.  I just keep thinking - this will be over eventually and I will have a newfound fear of the dentist. At least the dentist and his nurse are nice - even though it's VERY difficult to communicate (if at all), they are both light-hearted and the nurse is comforting when I'm in 'The Chair' tensing to all hell.                       \",\n",
       " \"                           Well, it happened. It took who knows how many years for it to finally happen, but it did!  As of yesterday afternoon, as the pain was still settling down, I had all 6 crowns cemented into place! I have a smile again! In addition to the crowns, the metal brace that has been on the bottom of my mouth for the past 5-7 years (I don't remember when it was put it) was also removed. After everything was said and done and I got to look into the mirror, I was giddy like a school girl! The dentist and nurse were thoroughly entertained by my giggling and inability to not act like an 8 year old on Christmas Day. ^.^  Photo(s) soon, I promise. I have to take them and PNG-ize the image.   All in all the cost for everything over the last month was 161,000HUF ($785.37). Not being insurred, that's a helluva good price!  As per dentists orders, I cannot eat solid foods until this afternoon, so as to give the cement time to set all good and proper. Also, per orders, I am to wait until the Fall to continue dental work. This will give my gums time to rest, heal and set in with the new crowns.  Yay!   Current Mood:  Happy/Giddy  Currently listening to:  103.9FM RádioEgy (Radio 1)                       \",\n",
       " \"                           Well, that was an interesting race. Kind of. I must say, the Canadian GP is awesome because of the straight-aways the it has, allowing for some massive speed.   I'll give props to Michael Schumacher for being the first ever to win a Grand Prix 7 times, but damnit someone else needs to win! Renault showed lots of promise, but Truli was out even before Turn 1! I won't ask about the massive pileup on Turn 3, as ITV1 did a shoddy job of covering it, but it looks like it was rather painful for Webber.   Kimi did amazingly well consindering all the problems he had. Between 5 pits, 3 steering wheel changes and a slew of other problems he still managed 2 points out of this race! He certainly seems to have picked up some motivation to get back into the game, especially with the new chassis from McLaren on it's way.  BAR Honda had their ups-and-downs again, just like the qualifiers. What in the bloody hell is up with Sato's engines?! This is, what, the 3rd (4th?) engine blow in a row? The ITV1 announcers mentioned something about development parts being used in Sato's engine - can anyone provide more details? I just don't get how Sato's car is blowing all the time and Button's doesn't. Yes, their driving styles are different and Sato is still learning to handle all the power he's been given this season, but Button has been pushing his car to some seriously competitive limits without these problems. Button did have a good day today. He did finish at P4, back from his P2 start, but he still had the pride of keeping ahead of Montoya. It might've been a different story if both Renault cars finished, but Button has proven that even that won't stop him from earning a 1st place finish.  I am happy to see Williams get a podium position with Ralf, taking 2nd. He deserves some non-negative lime-lite, as he does seem to be a very competent driver. Hopefully things between him and Montoya calm down.  We'll see how things go at Indianapolis next weekend as the US GP takes place. I'm still getting familiar with the track layouts, but hopefully there's some excitement to be had. I would love to see Button and Sato both have a good race and maybe Toyota eek into the top 8. Da Matta has been improving greatly of late.  Do I sound like an announcer? Heh. Maybe. I guess I just enjoy that there's something I can actually keep pace with - not like baseball, basketball, football, soccer, tennis, golf, yadda, yadda.   On a show called TopGear this evening (on ITV1 I think), they showed another alternatively powered car: Methane. Putting it into a slightly modified natural-gas powered vehicle, they ran a car off human methane and cow methane! Guys - Taco Bell might actually help us save fuel costs in the future! =^_^=                       \",\n",

       " \"                           Yep...I'm back from my vacation...EARLY! Sucks, I tell ya. We woke up this morning to rain. Listened to the radio and it said 'iscolated thundershowers are probable' in Coure d' Alene language, that means it's gonna downpour and you have an increased chance of being hit by lightning. Thusly, we got up outta that joint to where it was dry!            Despite the ucky ending, the trip was fun overall...let's start from the top shall we?           Mom wakes me up at 6 a.m. which isn't a bad thing because I'm pretty used to it because of zero hour last year (conditioning fun fun fun). I crawl into the back of our truck and make sure my mother doesn't open up the window of the canopy that is on the exhaust pipe side...that would be BAD!           We drive along...I fall asleep. We get to Coure d' Alene at about 11 a.m. and I wake up to my mom deciding to be in a shopping frenzy (which I did not complain). I ended up walking out with $300 worth of clothing...(isn't it great being the youngest child by 12 years...I think so)Hehe...well it was school clothes so it wasn't that great. I won't go into great detail of what I got...It would take to long =P!           Then we get to camp... Wolf Lodge Campgrounds just outside Coure d' Alene off Exit 22 off I-90. Fun stuff. We pitch camp and then we sit there on our butts because my brother and his girlfriend and her daughter won't arrive until the next day. The parental units claimed it was too late to ski at 6 p.m. when it's light out until 9:30, but oh well.            I discovered that air-matresses suck and the ground with rocks, holes, and thorns is a lot more comfortable than that is, which is why I eventually ended up deflating my air matress.            Next morning my parents bicker with me over what time we should go out skiing...they think I'd be too cold at 7 a.m. but wouldn't you think it would be for me to decide? I think so.            We get out on the lake and I finally learned how to get up out of the water on one ski. In the past I've gotten up with two ski's and dropped one, making us have to stay in the same area so we don't lose sight of the ski (with their high street value and all) lol. That was fun. Then the fun bragaide (Justin, Sanya, and Courtney) arrive, making us all revert to immature 12 year olds who are obsessed with stupid jokes, noises, and actions...not the most proud moment of my life lol.           Skiing was fun for the next day and a half and I got burnt extremely bad on my face, back, legs...you name it I'm  probably burnt somehow. That inhibited my ability to ski by a large percent being as my life vest would rub against my burt shoulders creating more pain than there was before...but it was worth it!!!           Yep...that was basically my ski trip. Though the freaky thing throughout it is that before I left, my friend Kyle goes 'just wait 'til you get to the camp, there will be a red jeep there waiting for you. Now red jeep if you've read in my earlier blogs is the vehicle my ex stalker boyfriend drives, so throughout the entire vacation I saw about...oh...30 red jeeps...exactly like his...wow...am I paranoid or what? I think so.          Yeah...to top off the entire vacation though, we were in the middle of packing and Sanya walks up to me and goes 'what is in your hair?' I am initially freaked out thinkin a bug or something...come to find out a bird crapped on my hair...THAT SUCKED! We were leaving and all i could do was rinse it off with a facuset. SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS! SIX HOURS IN A CAR knowing you have bird crap germs in your hair! I was so glad when I saw our house. I bolted out of the back of the truck into a shower! Ugh it sucked...But now I'm clean, red, buring, and Aloe Vera is my best friend right now.           Fourth of July is going to suck because I have NO plans. We were supposed to watch fireworks in Idaho...but obvioulsy we are not...oh well, maybe I'll find something to do...prolly not! I'm outie! Bye =)       \",\n",

HA! take that, you starnes & chernobyl fucks!      (i do not intend to fully pursue employment at another bookstore.  i just want to get out of the HOUSE, is all. and it's something that i know a great deal about as far as areas of employment go, the hours are not as fucktipated, i have to look for jobs one way or another, and i can still plan the rest of my life if i get part time.)       and now i am going to go watch out the window and think like a cat.      soundtrack: white stripes,   de stijl       (out.)         \",\n",

Very straight forward, nested-thread style organization with a simple  urlLink Google  interface and awesome DHTML and JavaScript dynamism.  Yes, there is the normal Google 'content-based' ad on the right side that you find when you do a Google or  urlLink Froogle , but it is usually only 2 or 3 ads versus the added number you have in a search. It is indeed based off the content of the e-mail - one e-mail I recieved dealt with a hiking trip to Cunningham Falls, and there were ads for hiking equipment and hiking oriented websites. I find the idea very cool, along with the content-based Google ad that is here (not shown atm, thanks to CSS, as I want banner free on the blog until I can figure out how to place it - if it's possible), even if people out there are screaming privacy. The 1,000MB of storage space is a major plus as well, as I can use this mail account to store large files and download then when I get the change versus having to pull huge files on my seriously limited bandwidth at home.  In all, after day 1 of using Gmail, I am already addicted to the service. I am eagerly awaiting the full offical launch!                       \",\n",

Highlights:   'Used to be, TV was the answer,' proclaimed the president of GM North America. 'The only problem is that it stopped working sometime around 1987.'   [They] share a hunger for 'authenticity.' If the ad message doesn't jibe with the brand's image, forget it. And say good-bye to the hard sell as well.   The lessons for Madison Avenue are clear. If you want to capture this demographic's attention, be prepared to entertain and don't be afraid to polarize the audience.    'They have a total ability to block out anything they don't want to get through. From an advertising standpoint, that's what makes this animal so scary.'   'We're eating the networks' lunch!' crows Jeff Brown, EA's vice president of corporate communications.   'When people used to say, 'We'd like to do guerrilla marketing,' that translated to, 'We don't have any money,'' quips Andrew Gledhill, president of the LA-based ad agency Ground Zero. 'When they said, 'We'd like to do something viral,' that meant, 'We really, really don't have any money.''

       " \"                          A furor has arisen over the rollout of a new form of audience measurement for television. The flap concerns so-called 'Local People Meters' being deployed by Nielsen Media Reasearch, the ratings people, in Los Angeles, New York and other major cities. Critics complain that the new computer-driven technology undercounts certain viewers compared to the old paper diary system. In reality what is happening is that for the first time an accurate measurement is being recorded and interested parties are fighting to keep the status quo. Put another way, television networks that have earned staggering sums off the old system are fighting being held accountable to their advertisers for the first time.  Most of us would argue that being accountable is a good thing. We, like advertisers, would like to think we're getting what we've paid for. That's why savvy advertisers have already pushed for greater accountability, not on television where too many technological barriers exist, but in the interactive advertising arena. Ad spending online is moving away from scattershot approaches such as banner ads and pop-ups, to targeted, immersive experiences that offer numerous user metrics and ultimately, accountability.  Armchair Media has helped pioneer this concept in its work with ING. If you're not already a fan, please visit  urlLink ING MoneyMentor  to see how we've executed the concept of Brand Enagagement for ING. We think it's indicative of where most interactive advertising is headed and feel proud to be held accountable for its success.  Story:    urlLink Link                          \",\n",

I think everyone  REALLY needs to know which breed of dog they are (Can it really be possible that  I am a chihuahua?) And as for me, I am glad to know that if I were an umbrella  drink, I would be a daquairi! I also found out that I am right brained, my true  color is green (but the color of my aura is orange).

This is very sad  because now it's focus appears not to be&nbsp;on providing quizzes for  the&nbsp;Egoist looking for ways to waste time, but&nbsp;on running an on-line  match-making service and on making money. A couple years ago, all these tests  were free... even the&nbsp;more rigorous ones (like the Briggs Myers inspired  ones etc).

       " \"                          Boring mission. We had another routine presence  patrol in 14E. It was just as uneventful as the last. We got back to the  barracks about 2200 and I decided to take a shower&nbsp;and a nap before our  next mission. Once again, I found myself having difficulty performing a simple  task because I could not take my mind off of Venus. I love you, honey bunny. I  love you so much. I miss you more every day.     It was a quick nap. Our next misson began at 0300,  so preparations started at 0030. We were tasked to provide backup for a group of  British SAS who were conducting a raid in our sector. That is what they told us.  We knew, however, that the SAS was more than capable of handling the situation.  We were there because they were in our sector and the Batallion Commander wanted  some of his guys there to keep an eye on them and to get any glory if there was  any extra lying around. They were going in to get a suspected insurgent and any  paraphenalia they could grab quickly. The plan was simple. We would roll up and  surround the block while the SAS ran up and did one of thier stealthy, lightning  fast, 'knock down the door and make everyone play nice' routines. Then, two  little birds would land on the roof and pick the SAS and suspect up. It  shouldn't have taken more than two minutes, tops.      It looked really good. I did not see any SAS until  they were in the front yard, not that anyone was awake and would have seen them.  They came back out of the house about 30 seconds later saying that it was the  wrong guy. Bad intel again. The mission was a failure, but at least it was not  our fault. Of course, we would have had no effect on the outcome of the mission,  anyway.      We got back to the barracks before 0400. I was  hungry, but the chow hall was not going to be open again until 0630. I guess I  should have eaten before we left.            \",\n",

       " \"                          Custom  Calendar Providers for Outlook 2003       Most data sets in the world have some  inherently elegant way of being expressed. Frequencies over time are naturally  rendered as histograms. Percentages are routinely conveyed by statisticians  through pie charts. More relevant to those of us who spend the majority of our  days in meetings, time-based data is often expressed in the form of a calendar.  In fact, calendars make our lives easier by organizing activities into  timelines, allowing us to view event-based data from any number of angles.       Unfortunately for a developer, the  acquisition of new event-based data sources often translates into writing new  calendar controls to display that data. And while this is certainly a manageable  if not resource-consuming task, many individuals and organizations already have  installed on their home and work computers one of the most full-featured and  robust calendaring application ever to be written. I'm of course referring to  Outlook. Microsoft&reg; Office Outlook&reg; 2003 has simply stunning calendaring  capabilities. With Outlook, I can view weekly highlights, monthly summaries, and  daily snapshots. I can view the calendar in standard form or as an organized  list of events. I can view my personal calendar side-by-side with that of my  teammates, gaining the ability to drag-and-drop scheduled items between them. I  can even display a Microsoft Windows&reg; SharePoint&#8482; Services event list as a  calendar within Outlook.     With this feature set, it'd be a shame  to have to reinvent the wheel every time someone required the ability to display  a new data source. For example, why can't I use Outlook's calendaring  capabilities to display my group's server downtime schedule as culled from the  servers' event logs? Why can't I use it to display my Windows Scheduled Tasks?  Why can't I use it to display recent posts from my favorite RSS feeds? And why  can't I use it to display the recording schedule from my Windows XP Media  Center? In fact (drum roll please), I can.                  \",\n",

       " \"                          Diary of a Traveling Preacher                        Volume 5, Chapter 18                         June 2 - 12, 2004                        'The City of Scissors'   Our spring tour has been gaining momentum as we travel from town to town in southern Poland. As a result of well-organized publicity we have even had to turn people away at the door at some programs because the halls quickly filled to capacity. It is a bittersweet experience: sweet to see the overwhelming interest in Krsna consciousness, but bitter to see souls turned away after they have waited millions of lifetimes to come to Krsna.  Despite the growing interest, I continue to notice some apathy toward our movement among the general mass of people when we go on our chanting parties. One can easily feel the mood of the public by being on the street. Fewer people take interest in our kirtan parties than previous years, and it is not uncommon to get cold stares and even rude remarks.  I have preached in Poland since 1989, and I have seen the changes in the country firsthand, so I can tell that the present coldness toward us comes from the so-called material progress. Although material progress brings facility and comforts, it is a double-edged sword, also bringing immorality and degradation, mostly because of an increase in meat eating, intoxication, illicit sex, and gambling. A preacher is not surprised though: being versed in sastra, he's prepared for the advance of Kali Yuga.  tvam nah sandarsito dhatra dustaram nistitirsatam kalim sattva-haram pumsam karna-dhara ivarnavam  'We think that we have met Your Goodness by the will of providence, just so that we may accept you as captain of the ship for those who desire to cross the difficult ocean of Kali, which deteriorates all the good qualities of a human being.'  [Srimad Bhagavatam 1.1.22]  We decided to decrease our security on the spring tour this year because the hall programs would be much smaller than before, allowing us to give more attention to our audiences. But seeing the animosity of people toward us on the street, we have felt obliged to take measures to protect ourselves in some places.  The local congregation leader in Walbrzych, Trisama prabhu, organized a police escort for our two-hour Harinam through the streets. Four policemen walked along with us, and we even had a patrol car with lights flashing in front of us. As we started Harinam that day, the officer in charge smiled and motioned that we should chant down the middle of the street. People waved at us, and shop owners came out to see the fun. Many good-hearted people enjoyed the 'parade,' and we got a large crowd at our program that evening.  Nevertheless times have changed, and I often find myself reflecting on the gradual loss of piety among the Polish people and the resentment toward us among some of them. Relief comes, however, at those moments when I see people's lives touched by Krsna's mercy through our efforts to preach. Seeing transformations in people lives is the only reward a preacher hopes for.  An example is a relatively new devotee who lives in Walbrzych. After the guests had left our program, I asked him whether he had invited his parents. He replied that his mother and father were divorced but he had invited his father, who lived nearby. His father, however, was inimical toward Krsna consciousness and had vehemently refused. Thus the boy was amazed when halfway through the program he saw his father sitting in the audience.  After the program, his father came up to him. 'Son,' he said, 'please forgive any misunderstandings I had about this movement. I enjoyed the program immensely. You have my support for what you are doing.'  'What about your mother?' I asked.  'Oh my mother has no problems with my being a devotee,' he said laughing.  'My mother is very conservative,' he continued, 'but she accompanied a close friend, on the friend's request, to the Warsaw temple last year for a Sunday feast. My mother was so impressed with the program and the blissful nature of the devotees that she prayed to 'the God on the altar' to please make her son a Hare Krsna devotee. At that time I was heavily involved in drugs and criminal activities.  'Three months later I met devotees and joined the movement, and I gave up all my bad habits. At that time, my mother told me of her fervent prayer. She is so grateful to 'the God on the altar' that she thanks Him every day in her morning and evening prayers.'  As our tour went on, I was especially looking forward to our program in Kielce, a moderate-sized town of 100,000 people nestled in a beautiful forested region of Poland. In 1993 we had a small but successful festival there, and I remembered the people as especially pious.  Our congregation members there were eager to have us return, and in recent weeks, they had gone out of their way to put up hundreds of posters. I considered hiring a security firm, but I remembered the warmth of the people, and when I heard of the growing interest in the festival within our congregation, I decided against it.  My decision would prove to be a mistake, however, and almost cost us dearly, for Kali-yuga has firmly taken root in Kielce since my visit in 1993.  I had my first hint of trouble as we drove through the center of town. I saw that many of our posters had been ripped down. This has always been a sure sign of antagonism. When we arrived at the hall two hours before the program, 10 devotees from the congregation were waiting for us. Their faces were anxious.  'Srila Gurudeva' one of them said, 'two young men from a right-wing political party just came here and told the director of the hall to cancel our program or be prepared for the worst. They told him we are a dangerous sect and they will stop our festival one way or another. We had to convince the director that we are not a cult. He was obviously afraid of the threats, but he tentatively agreed to let the festival go on.'  'I suspected something was amiss,' I said, 'when I saw all the posters in town ripped up.'  'Yes,' a devotee replied, 'and yesterday the same youths were grabbing invitations from the hands of the devotees on the street. When they threatened violence, the devotees had to stop.'  'How many are they?' I asked.  'For now we've only seen two,' came the reply.  I paused for a moment. 'It's just two local men,' I thought, 'so we can go out on Harinam.'  Before each festival, we have a powerful one-hour kirtan to add a last touch of publicity, but on this day the preparations - setting up the stage and decorating the hall - were late, so Bhakta Dominique, the main organizer of our spring tour, asked that most devotees stay behind to help. Thus our little Harinam party of six devotees went blithely out onto the streets and into the jaws of the lion.  We had only been chanting 10 minutes when we were attacked from behind by several men in their early twenties. I was leading the kirtan party down the street, so I did not notice the scuffle at the back. But then I heard Narottam das's voice above the kirtan. 'Let go!' he was shouting. 'Let go!'  I reeled around and saw that one of the attackers had wrested the microphone and small amplifier from Narottam. Then the man head-butted Narottam's face, but Narottam was undeterred and grabbed back the microphone and amplifier. The kirtan came to a stop, and we confronted the men.  As soon as I saw their faces I remembered the attack on our Harinam party in Sarajevo, Bosnia, some years ago. As in Sarajevo, the men's eyes were full of hate and their lips were trembling from anger. They stood with clenched fists, ready to attack us at any moment. I also noted that they all wore the same gray-colored t-shirts with an insignia and writing in small print. As I reached for my canister of tear gas, I saw from the corner of my eye a number of other youths surrounding us.  By a quirk of fate there were no Polish devotees on the Harinam. For a few moments our attackers were put off-guard in the heated exchange of words because we were speaking in a foreign language. But just when they motioned to their friends to come forward, Sri Prahald spoke up in broken Polish. 'Don't use force,' he said. 'Tell us what you want.'  One man put his face close to Sri Prahlad. 'All right,' he growled in Polish, 'I'm advising you to get out of here immediately.'  We had only seconds to decide what to do. 'Let's have kirtan,' said one devotee, undeterred by their threats.  But as Sri Prahlad and I looked at each other, we conveyed the same thought without speaking a word: 'Remember Sarajevo.' I won't go so far as to say our exchange was telepathy. Let us simply say it was the result of a camaraderie developed after years of preaching together. It wasn't the first time we had faced such a situation.  In Sarajevo we had initially repulsed an attack by three Muslim men on our kirtan party. Devotees had fought back and smashed one of the attackers through the plate-glass window of a store. But then instead of retreating in the face of a superior aggressor ('Discretion is the better part of valor') we stood defiantly and chanted Nrsimha prayers. Thirty men then ruthlessly attacked us with pistols and knives. The rest is history.  Sri Prahlad and I nodded our unspoken agreement. 'Okay,' I said, 'we're pulling out.'  We put away our instruments (but not my tear gas) and started walking slowly in the direction of the hall. But I became suspicious when I saw one of the men walking just in front of us, off to the side, while speaking on his cell phone. He was glancing back at us from time to time. 'We're walking into a trap,' I thought.  Sri Prahlad took out his cell phone and called Dominique to tell him we needed someone who could speak Polish.  After walking a few more steps, I saw a group of skinheads coming down the street from the other direction. I could see that the man in front of us and the skinheads were speaking on the phone together. The skinheads began rubbing their knuckles and looked around to see if there were any police in sight. I also looked around. There were none to be seen.  Suddenly I remembered my Nrsimha mantra. 'Why haven't I chanted it yet?' I thought. At that moment I remembered Uttara, the mother of Maharaja Pariksit, and how she called out for Lord Krsna when she saw a nuclear weapon coming toward her:  Uttarovaca pahi pahi maha-yogin deva-deva jagat-pate nanyam tvad abhayam pasye yatra mrtyuh parasparam  'Uttara said: O Lord of lords, Lord of the universe! You are the greatest of mystics. Please protect me, for there is no one else who can save me from the clutches of death in this world of duality.'  [Srimad Bhagavatam 1.8.9]  In a fraction of a second another thought raced through my mind. 'Here is the difference between a pure devotee and me,' I thought. 'She remembers the Lord at every moment, and I forget Him at the slightest hint of danger.'  And so I chanted the mantra for the first of many times that day.  Just then Dominique came around the corner and asked what the trouble was. Sri Prahlad pointed out the man in front of us, and Dominique courageously approached him. Because Dominique was dressed in ordinary clothes and carried an air of authority, the man with the cell phone seemed a little taken aback. Apparently it caused him to call off the imminent attack of the skinheads. Our Harinam party quickly turned the corner and walked a few meters more to the safety of the hall.  'That was a close one,' I said to Sri Prahlad.  'Too close,' came his reply.  Dominique soon returned, and we discussed the situation. The main problem was that earlier in the day these men had told the director of the hall that they would return to disrupt our festival. Obviously, next time they would come with their friends and sympathizers.  I asked Dominique who they were, and he told me they were part of a Christian-based political party with radical views. They believed that Poland was only for Poles and the only religion in Poland should be Christianity. In recent years, the party has attracted many young men, who propagate and deliver their message with force. In areas where they are strong they do not tolerate public demonstrations contrary to their ideology.  Apparently Kielce is their party headquarters, and the local people rarely, if ever, hold outdoor public functions out of fear of them. More than once they had attacked such programs, resulting in bloody fighting and chaos.  'I suspect they were the ones behind the attack on our festival program in Tomaszow a few years ago,' Dominique said.  I looked at my watch. The program was to begin in one hour. Considering that we had no security whatsoever, I proposed that we cancel the event. It wasn't worth the risk of injury to our devotees or guests. We would be far outnumbered. Dominique thought for a moment and suggested we notify the police of the situation. I reminded him how unreliable the police had been in Tomaszow. Dominique then suggested we hire a reliable security firm to protect us.  I thought for a moment. 'It sounds reasonable,' I said, 'but I want 15 security men here in 30 minutes, or we cancel.'  Dominique went into action. It was easy to inform the police, but finding 15 professional security men in a town the size of Kielce in a few minutes would be almost impossible. Generally, security firms want at least three days' notice. Dominique called seven companies, but they either were closed by that hour or didn't have the manpower available.  Time was of the essence. People, eager as always for our show, were already arriving, and the hall was filling up. I knew that it would be an easy job for the thugs. All they had to do was show up as they did in Tomaszow with baseball bats, smash a few people and cars for three or four minutes, and then run for it. I looked at Dominique. 'You've got five minutes more,' I said.  He called the last security firm in the phone book and explained our problem. The man in charge said he could be at the hall in 20 minutes with 15 men. But we'd have to 'pay a heavy fee.'  Dominique looked at me. 'I've got a firm,' he said.  'How much will it cost?' I asked.  'Twelve hundred dollars,' he said.  My eyebrows went up. 'Twelve hundred dollars!' I gasped.  'But the show will go on,' Dominique said, 'and that's what's important. I'll raise the money from the congregation. Don't worry.'  I paused and thought for a moment. Many people had already come, and we had a reputable security firm to protect us. 'Okay,' I said, 'let's go for it. But I want all of our children out of here now. Put them in that van and take them with some of the mothers to a safe apartment. We'll pick them up after the show tonight.'  I didn't want to take any chances. I knew how determined a group of fanatics can be.  We waited anxiously for the security firm to show up, and we locked all but one of the three entrances to the hall. Now that we were determined to go on, devotees busied themselves with last-minute preparations, but all eyes were turned toward the street where the men would come from.  As the hour approached, one fearless devotee stayed out on the sidewalk in front of the hall, distributing invitations. I saw a group of men surround him ready to fight, just as the first of the security vans arrived. By Krsna's grace two policemen on street duty saw the potential trouble and broke up the situation. The devotee quickly retreated into the hall.  The men on the security team were all huge and mean looking, with enormous muscles. They gathered and took quick instructions from the head of the security firm. He was a well-dressed man, and I breathed easier when I learned that he was in charge of the anti-terrorist force in the region. The men all took strategic positions around the hall. Three of the biggest stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the entrance. Some of the guests who arrived at that time laughed at the display of power. They were unaware of the situation and probably thought it was part of the act.  When 10 of the troublemakers assembled on the other side of the street looking toward us, I saw the security men fidget a little - not from any fear, I thought, but bracing themselves for a fight.  A devotee sensed my concern. 'Don't worry,' he said. 'They're used to it. This town is called The City of Scissors.'  'What does that mean?' I asked.  'This is the stronghold of that right-wing political party,' he said. 'Their youth organization is infamous for fighting with scissors. It's their trademark, and they're not afraid to use them, but these security men have dealt with them before.'  I walked into the hall and onto the stage. I was surprised to see a full house. Of course, considering that all our previous programs had had full houses, I shouldn't have been surprised. Still, the trouble brewing had made me think that attendance at the program would be sparse, but the people knew nothing of the potential danger.  For added safety, we had the front entrance to the hall locked and secured. If there was to be a fight between our opposition and security, the guests didn't have to know about it.  In the meantime, Sri Prahlad had a quick meeting with as many devotees as he could muster and showed them a small stairwell leading up to a metal platform above the stage. 'If trouble comes,' he told them, 'all the women should immediately climb up there.'  We then started our opening act, a bhajan, but I could hear tension in the voices of the devotees. I noticed that unlike other festival bhajans, where the devotees' eyes were serenely closed, all the devotees had their eyes wide open, looking at the audience.  After the bhajan, Keli Cancala dasi came on to perform an Odissi dance. As she began, I took the opportunity to slip out the back door to see what the situation was outside.  I was not surprised to find a number of the political youths facing off with the security men. Although the security outnumbered (and outsized) them, they were unfazed and determined to break up our festival. One of the security men motioned for me to get back in the hall. Stepping back slowly, I watched several of the youths try to force open the locked entrances.  At that moment Dominique came out. One particularly tough-looking youth, apparently their leader, recognized him from the previous encounter on the street. He pulled an invitation out of his pocket. 'I demand that you let me in,' he said.  'No way,' Dominique said, and he motioned to the security men to remove them. The youths conferred with each other for a moment and then left, obviously with another plan in mind. As they left, one of them stopped in front of Dominique, who stood there fearlessly. The youth slid his hand across his own throat in a threatening gesture.  'We know who you are,' he said, 'and we will get you. We'll be back soon, and this time nothing will stop us.'  Suddenly Narottam appeared from behind and said I had to come quickly, as it was time for my lecture.  'My lecture?' I thought. 'How will I lecture in this frame of mind?'  As I came back in the hall, the director approached Dominique and said he had to unlock all the entrances. 'Rules and regulations say they have to be open at all times,' he said. 'I just can't leave them locked any longer. There are too many people here.'  The fact that all the entrances were now open made me nervous. I had seen how those youths had tried to force open the same doors to get in, even in the presence of the security team.  As a precaution, I stopped by the dressing room on my way to the stage. I took my CS gas from my bag and carefully placed it in my kurta pocket. Then I grabbed a wooden axe handle and hid it under my chaddar. I kept my running shoes on.  I walked onto the stage and sat down on the seat provided. As I adjusted myself, I wondered if any spiritual master in the past had ever ascended such a holy seat armed with weapons at the ready.  As the translator and I adjusted our microphones, I saw a security man take his position near the stage, just two meters away from me. As he sat down, his eyes scanned the crowd and the three open entrances.  Despite all these precautions, I knew that only the Lord could protect us from the imminent danger. I closed my eyes and joined my palms, and I slowly recited a prayer, as I usually do before beginning my lecture. But this time, instead of calling on the mercy of the acaryas, I called on the mercy of Lord Nrsimhadeva:  durgesv atavy-aji-mukhadisu prabhuh payan nrsimho 'sura-yuthaparih vimuncato yasya mahatta-hasam diso vinedur nyapatams ca garbhah  'May Lord Nrsimhadeva, who appeared as the enemy of Hiranyakasipu, protect us in all directions. His loud laughing vibrated in all directions and caused the pregnant wives of the asuras to have miscarriages. May that Lord be kind enough to protect us in difficult places like the forest and battlefront.'  [Srimad Bhagavatam 6.8.14]  Then I prayed silently to Srila Prabhupada to give me the ability to focus on my lecture so that the people who had come would have the same opportunity to understand the philosophy as those who had come to our previous festivals.  The audience of 150 people listened respectfully as I began my lecture. I explained the importance of the human form of life in being able to understand spiritual knowledge. I slowly developed my talk to explain that we are not these bodies and how the soul transmigrates to another body at death. But as I continued, I began losing my concentration, remembering the threat of the angry young man to come back with his comrades. At one point my focus went from the lecture, to the open entrances. It was only with great effort that I forced my mind back and continued speaking.  Several times, as my translator was repeating what I had said, I had to bring my mind back to my lecture. 'Stay fixed,' I would tell myself. 'This may be the only time these people ever get to hear the absolute truth.'  When I finally came to the end of my talk, I felt I had not done my duty well, but as I stood up, there was thunderous applause from the audience.  After our theater group performed, Sri Prahlada led the audience in a session of meditation on the Hare Krsna mantra. But he also appeared apprehensive. Instead of closing his eyes, as he usually does in the session, he kept them wide open.  The program was coming to an end. On the suggestion of the security men, we had kept our acts short so we could finish the festival before dark. They told us that the youths would most likely return under the cover of darkness. And because we had upstaged them, they would be doubly angry and eager for revenge.  As we sat down for the last kirtan on stage, I looked at my watch and saw I had only 10 minutes before the designated time to finish. Then suddenly Dominique appeared and told me that prasadam was late and I'd have to chant for at least half an hour.  I started kirtan slowly, but the people could not contain their enthusiasm, and I had to pick up the pace. Soon they were clapping wildly and chanting loudly along with us. Some even got up and danced in the aisles. A number of children came right to the front and began dancing blissfully back and forth.  Within a few minutes the hall became Vaikuntha, the spiritual world. I marveled at the mercy of the Lord: while danger swirled around us like an ominous whirlpool, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was busy delivering these people by the sweetness of His holy names.  sarvatara bhajatam jananam tratum samarthah kila sadu varta bhaktan abhaktan api gaura candras tatra krsnamrta nama danaih  'The news broadcast by the saints is that all the avatars of the Lord are indeed capable of delivering Their devoted followers who worship Them. However, Sri Gauracandra delivered both devotees and non-devotees alike with His gifts of Sri Krsna's ambrosial names.'  [Srila Sarvabhauma Battacarya, Susloka Satakam, text 42]  Devotees and guests dove and surfaced in the nectar of the holy names, and for a few moments even I myself forgot the danger at hand. But when the kirtan ended, I remembered the advice of our security. I thanked the people for coming and asked them to move quickly to the entrance hall, where prasadam was being served.  As the guests took prasadam, the devotees quickly packed our gear and put it in the vans. Within minutes we were ready to go.  The security team seemed on red alert as the evening sky became darker. Several times they pointed to their watches, indicating we should finish quickly. Although there was a relaxed and joyful mood among the guests, the security team was anxious to move them on. Word came that there was an unusually large assembly of unruly men gathering on the city square a hundred meters away. 'You must all leave now,' the chief of security said to us.  Most of the guests had left by that time, and I asked the devotees to quickly clear the hall. Dominique sent a van with three security men in it to pick up the children and women at the apartment, and when they arrived, all of us jumped into our four vans and started to pull out. Darkness was descending.  The security team escorted us in their cars to the city limits. When we reached the road to Warsaw they turned back. We were then on our own. But at that moment, I realized that in fact we had never been alone - not even for a second. The all-merciful Lord had been with us the entire time. Otherwise, how had we escaped certain injury and defeat and tasted the sweetness of victory and success?  yatra yogesvarah krsno yatra partho dhanur dharah tatra srir vijayo bhutir dhruva nitir matir mama  'Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.'  [Bhagavad Gita 18.78] www.traveling-preacher.com Official website for Diary of a Traveling Preacher  urlLink              \",\n",

Developing a dazzling online presence is great, of course, but you'd be surprised how many massive enterprises disregard some of the most basic rules of corporate site design, neglect to update material and contact info, or feature tools and forms that fail to perform. Such faults not only reflect poorly on the business behind the site but also do wonders for its competition.  Smaller businesses are fortunate because they're less likely to have a network of local or international subsites to monitor and manage. But the big guys have no excuse. Today, a Web site can't be treated as an afterthought. A company's online presence is vitally important to its corporate image. Large companies just can't afford to make mistakes online.  Of course, small businesses, ever on the lookout for free education, are thankful they do.'   Full Story:   urlLink Link                          \",\n",

       " \"                          Happy Pentecost!   50 days after Passover,    Harvest in the Jewish calendar. For us, the celebration of the fulfillment of    a promise - the coming of the Holy Spirit to us. Jesus promised his friends    that when he left, he would not leave us abandoned - that he would send us another    helper. He was sending us His own life - the same life that He had walking around    here - the Spirit of God to dwell in us. That's all, just a real metaphysical    connection to the eternal substructure of the universe, to God, the eternal    one - that's all!!! If we receive this gift He has given us, we open ourselves    to something HUGE - much bigger than a set of beliefs or even a commitment to    a bunch of cool people. Those things factor in but they are not the core - they    eminate from the core of spiritual union with God through the indwelling Spirit.    Amazing. Amazing that we would think of this as anything other than mind-blowingly    gigantic in its significance to us and to the world.                  We had a great celebration with our own small community and several friends    and freinds of friends. That milling around up there is what we like to call    the &quot;sacrament of fellowship.&quot; It IS a part of the &quot;service.&quot;    That's a little off-culture to many, and we have to keep re-brainwashing ourselves    to know that as soon as people get there to come together in one place, things    have started - it's happening.    The Antiphon for our chanted Evening Prayer last night said this:  On the    day of Pentecost they had all gathered together in one place, alleluia.     This is the context in which the promise was fulfilled - in the context of community    - of US, gathered together in one place.That's what   Pentecost      is:  Us, gathered together in one place for this reason - to receive eternal    life - to open ourselves to the life of God to come dwell in us and make us    alive like Jesus.  It is the life of eternity breaking into the world, doing    the work of creation, of recreation in us, through us, around us.             We had fun in community. Great fellowship; great worship; great conversation.    I think we were built up to go out and be the people that God has created us    to be - that He is continually recreating us to be.         \",\n",

       " \"                          I did not get out of the internet cafe until about  0025 last night (or this morning, actually), which was was good, considering  that the chow hall closes at 0030. I did not notice the time until 0020, because  I was so enthralled in the process of making my laptop act nice. Now this is a  story.     About 4 days ago, I finally got fed up with having  my hard drive in two partitions. Partitions are not necessarily a bad thing, but  my laptop came factory with a 10 GB hard drive with a&nbsp;2.35  GB&nbsp;partition storing a drive image of the hard drive as it came from the  factory, with Windows Me, Office 2000, McAfee Virus Scan 6, and everything else  that it had from factory. This was necessary, since it did not come with  everything on CD. What was not necessary was it's size, as the image is only a  1.65 GB file. This left with 700 MB of free space on that partition. That would  have worked out alright if it was large enough to use as a temporary folder for  burning CD's, however, for some reason I need 1 GB of free space to burn a  CD.This resulted in my having to move a lot of files around in order to burn a  CD, which was a real pain in the neck.     My first idea was to burn the drive image to a  couple of CD's, delete the files, and use Ranish Partition Manager to make  one&nbsp;large, single partition on my disk. A little thought in this area made  me see that I did not want to waste 3 CD-R's burning an image of old software,  when I have Windows XP, Office XP, Norton Anti-virus 2002, and other newer  versions of the software I use.     I then decided to repartition and reformat the  drive, install Windows XP and only the software I need, and then burn a drive  image of&nbsp;that configuration while it was as pure as the driven snow. I had  no idea of the problems it would cause.     The first problem I ran into was that my DVD  decoder software, while funtional after upgrading Windows XP over Windows Me,  would not install at all onto a Windows XP machine.     The second and most unnerving problem arose when I  attemted to activate this new installation of Windows XP.&nbsp;I ran the  activation wizard as usual, only after it connected to the internet, it  displayed a screen the likes of which I have never seen. I don't remember  everything it said verbatum, but I clearly recall the first line of the page.  'According to our records, the number of times you can activate Windows with  this product key has been exceeded.' It then&nbsp;asked me to input a different  product key in the box below it.&nbsp;It did have a button underneath that said  'Activate by telephone'. Upon clicking this button, I see that it has a toll  free number to call from if you are in the United States. Below this, it said to  select what country you are in to get an alternate number, and it had a  drop-down combo box beside that. Being that I am currently in Baghdad and a 800  number would still cost me 50 cents per minute. I knew that they would have me  on hold for a while before I started the inevitable lenghthy  process.     I immediately started drafting an e-mail to send to  Microsoft to express my dismay. The following&nbsp;is a copy of that  e-mail.      &nbsp;    What the hell is this?!!!     I cannot believe my eyes. 'According to our  records, the number of times you can activate Windows with this product key has  been exceeded.' What kind of slimy, dishonorable, communist, twinkle-toes,  morally depraved BS is this?!!! I am appalled. What in the hell are you bastards  trying to do, take every last dime you possibly can get your grubby little hands  on? Do you really expect me to buy another copy of Windows? I must inform you  money loving heathens:     ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS, THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU  CAN OVERCHARGE ME FOR A BUGGY, BLOATED, INFERIOR, OBSOLETE, WORTHLESS, UNSTABLE  PIECE OF SOFTWARE HAS BEEN EXCEEDED.      Who the hell do you think you are?!!! This is about  as American as th Taj Mahal! I would call and try to activate windows by  telephone, but a am currently honorably serving in my beloved country's armed  forces in Baghdad, Iraq. I don't think I need to explain to you how expensive it  would be for me to call you disreputable miscreants, especially since I know you  will have me on hold for an hour with all the other VICTIMS of your evil,  dispicable, tyrannical regime. YOU DON'T HAVE A TOLL-FREE NUMBER FOR IRAQ, DO  YOU, YOU GREEDY AROGANT COLD-HEARTED BASTARDS?!!! No, of course not. Why not  scre over the very people that are fighting and dying for your protection? For  your liberty? For your right to right to rape the local economy of every last  shred of decency it has left? NO! I DRAW THE LINE THERE! YOU SORRY, NO COUNT,  VILE, CRUDE, CALLOUS, INSOLENT HOOLIGANS CAN KISS MY HAIRY WHITE BUTT.       I don't expect a reply from you morons. I'm not  worried about it. But I'm also not giving you one more cent. I never really  needed to pay you anything, but I did it out of decency. Things have changed.  What little respect I had for your organization just went out the window. I will  now go online and get one of the countless cracks that are available to bypass  your 'activation.' What I am upset with most is the fact that I am being forced  to go out of way to solve a problem that arose simply due to my periodic  reinstallation of Windows. If you are going to have this fascist stonewall in  place, either warn users before the installation, or make your operating system  capable of running for more than 6 months without swelling to rob nearly 3GB of  my limited storage. Those of us with 9.35BG laptop HDD's (It's 10GB raw...you  ****s) can't take this.      &nbsp;    After venting a little steam, I went to Microsoft's  website to find an e-mail address. I went to the support page, and clicked on  'Contact Us'. What I ran into amazed me. I understood the first screen that said  that if your copy of Windows came with your computer, you would have to contact  your system manufacturer. Since my copy of Windows XP came from HP, I was  concerned. I did not want to contact HP, I wanted to scream at Microsoft. I hate  Microsoft. I like HP. I've owned HP computers and&nbsp;periphrials in the past,  and I currently own a laptop, desktop, and external CR-RW drive from HP. I've  rarely had a problem with anything, but when I have, HP fixed it rather quickly,  and in the case of this laptop, every time I've turned it in for service,  they've changed out more than I had proplems with and upgraded it for free.  Faster processors and the&nbsp;DVD-ROM were nice, but a new battery and hard  drive that they did not have to change was really nice.Anyway, since my copy of  Windows came in the mail separate from the laptop, I figured I was good.  Ignoring that screen, I continued to the e-mail tab. It did not simply show you  and address, but asked&nbsp;me to input&nbsp;my product ID. It said that if your  product ID contained 'OEM', Windows came with your computer. Mine did. I put it  in any way. The next screen told me to contact HP. I could not even get an  e-mail address from them. I've bought several versions of Windows and other  things from Microsoft, I should be entitled to an e-mail address to send hate  mail.     I ended up posting this rant to their message  boards because that was the only way I could send them anything. Their message  board is not read by technicians at Microsoft, it is just a place to post a  question. If someone else is reading it (usually because they are posting a  question) and they know the answer or just want to say something else on that  topic, they can post a response. It is a good way of finding out how to do  things, but it would not solve my problem. I just wanted someone else to read  it.     I had already decided that I would just install a  copy of Windows XP Professional Edition that I aquired through a site license.  Site licesed software does not have to be activated. It is purchased by a  company to install on all of their computers, and they can make as many copies  as they need in order to install it on those computers. The US Army happens to  have one of those licenses, and since I use this computer for Army stuff mainly,  I have no problem using it.     Just when I had convinved myself to go about things  this way, I recieved a startling e-mail from HP. Aparently, someone at HP had  run across my little temper tantrum and invited me to go to HP's support webpage  for a live chat session with a technician.

My Name is Paul.How  may I assist you ?   Anthony Whittington First, some  background   Anthony Whittington I recieved this computer through  the eArmyU program. It originally came with Windows Me installed on it, but in  the box was a card that said to go to Compaq's website, and you could request a  free upgrade to XP. I did that, and every was OK.   Anthony  Whittington The problem arose when I turned my computer in for  servicing.   Anthony Whittington They installed a new HD and put a  DVD-ROM in it.   Paul Okay   Paul Listening  carefully...   Anthony Whittington The first problem was in trying  to Activate XP when I reinstalled it. I used the Product Key off of the  Certificate of Authenticity on the bottom of the computer, but there was an  error message saying that 'The number of times you can activate Windows with  this product key has been exceeded.   Anthony Whittington I would  call, but I am currently deployed in Baghdad   Anthony  Whittington That would be an expensive phone call   Anthony  Whittington The second issue is in getting a DVD Video  Decoder.   Anthony Whittington The one on the driver webpage is for  Me.   Anthony Whittington BTW, my computer was originally a 1200ta,  but now it comes up as a 12XL300   Anthony Whittington Any  help?   Paul First, Thanks for explaining things  clearly.   Paul Second problem has the  solution   Paul ..immediately.   Anthony  Whittington You're welcome   Paul I will provide the DVD decoder  download for windows xp now.   Paul Just a  minute...

Paul This link gives, Intervideo Win DVD  player   Paul You are most welcome.   Paul Checking on  the first problem.   Paul I understand that windows xp was installed  by you and used and had no problems. When it went to service center and came  back it displays such error .   Paul ..about the product  key.   Paul Am I right?   Paul or   Paul Is  there any modification on this ?   Anthony  Whittington yes   Paul Fine, ..   Anthony  Whittington I'm sorry, I was having difficulty understanding for a  bit.   Paul Consulting my supervisor on this product key  error.   Paul Are you able to use the software and the other  programs in the computer?   Anthony Whittington I can use everything  fine. I just cannot activate Windows. I keep getting the '26 days left for  activation' bubble.   Paul I see..   Paul Now I got  it..   Paul Please verify this:   Paul Click Start &gt;  Click Help and support&gt; Note whether it says compaq help and support or just  'Help and Support'?   Anthony Whittington It does not say 'Compaq.'  I did a complete reinstallion inadvertently.   Anthony  Whittington ...Instead of installing XP over Me.   Anthony  Whittington I failed to realize what I would lose when I did  this.   Paul I see,&nbsp; This could be the problem. If the Retail  OS CD is used and installed ( windows xp) then it will ask for a activation code  which can only be obtained from Microsoft.This might have been installed in  service center too. So the only solution is to contact the retailer ( if they  had installed this) and get the Activation code from  Microsoft.   Anthony Whittington I did not buy a retail version of  Windows. I used to XP upgrade CD I recieved from  Compaq/HP.   Paul In the CD case what is mentitoned: Is it mentioned  as windows xp CD key  ?     -------------------------------------------------------------- Chat  Transcript Ends Here   &nbsp;    At this point, I was typing a response when the  internet connevtion was lost.

       " \"                          I have got to get me an alarm clock. After lunch, I  had nothing better to do, so I took a nap. I did not wake up until 1700, which  only gave me 30 minutes to get ready to go on our next mission.      The next mission was another boring one. Presence  patrol in 14E. It&nbsp;is these missions that I refer to as a parade.&nbsp;We  drive around and wave to all the waving Iraqis. It is mainly the children who  are doing the waving, accompanied by cheering and request for candy, money,  chemlights, or cigarettes. I still dont understand what a 12 year old kid is  doing smoking. How young do they start here?      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Happy sixth birthday, son.  Here's your first pack&nbsp;of cigarettes.'     Muthana is one of the middle class districts of  Baghdad. It has its slums, some real nice neighborhoods, and some in between.  Everywhere except the real nice neighborhoods is trashy. And I do mean trashy.  Their standard garbage disposal process consists of dumping it in the street, an  open feild, or their front yard and setting it on fire. The people in the nicer  neighborhoods pay to have their trash trucked to the poorer neighborhoods and  burned.     The nice neighborhoods are nice. Many have  manicured lawns. Manicured is the only type of yard here. I guess if you can  afford to grow grass, you take care of it. The vast majority of the people just  rake their dirt/trash yard. The yards here are tiny. All of the houses have  shared walls, and the houses are generally about 8-12 ft off of the road. Also,  the norm is to have a stone wall around your yard in the nice neighborhoods.  Stone is the only type of wall here. When I say stone, what I mean this: They  take some bricks (no attention is paid to the size, condition color, etc.),  possibly 20 different kinds in one wall, and build a wall with just enough  mortar to hold them together temporarily. You can see through the wall at this  point. Then they skim coat the entire wall with an inch thick layer of mortar.  That is how every wall is made here. All of the floors are poured concrete. No  matter how tall the building. The chainlink fences are even put up on concete  poles. Wood is  SCARCE  here.      But as I was saying, the nice neighborhoods are  very nice. Many have marble driveways, ornate glasswork, beautiful wrought iron  railings, window bars, etc... Some of the most beautiful architecture I've  seen.     I have been sitting here waiting in line to get  online for the last 2 hours, and my turn is almost here. I'm going to send this  and go get some chow. I'll talk to you later.      &nbsp;     &nbsp;           \",\n",
       " \"                          I never did get that nap I was going to take. When  I got back to the barracks my platoon sergeant came to me. He asked if I wanted  to go to a Toby Kieth and Ted Nugent concert at BIAP. I told him that I hadn't  slept in a while, so I would rather just take a nap. He said that I was screwed  anyway, because we had just been called up to investigate a drive-by shooting in  our sector. It was mission or concert, and quite frankly I wanted to go shoot  someone. On top of that, there are four Toby Kieth fans in our platoon: Dave, my  driver, my machinegunner, and myself. My driver had been having a hard time  recently, and since there was only one seat, I sent him.      For the last several days my driver had been asking  me to drive the Humvee so that I could tell the mechanics what was wrong with  the suspension. With this in mind, I had my machinegunner man the M240 up top  and I was going to drive.     I had never driven an uparmored M1114 Humvee  before, and I have to tell you, it is fun. The first thing I noticed was that it  had a lot more power than your standard M998 Humvee. I had driven the M998 too  much to account for, and had driven the 2 1/2 ton M1097 Humvee on multiple  occasions. All military Humvees have&nbsp;a 6.2L (396 c.i.d.) Detroit Diesel  engine. The M998 is tuned so as to only have 156 HP&amp; 310 lb/ft of torque  and&nbsp;the M1097 is tuned for 189 HP &amp; 390 lb/ft of torque. The M1114 had  he same engine as the M1097, only with a turbocharger. Dave says that it only  has 190 HP, but it must have a hellacious amount of torque, because that thing  had some ass.     The second thing I noticed was that the rear view  mirrors were worthless, but it really doesn't matter when your driving an  armored truck. Dave ran a semi truck off the road with one of these things for  god's sake. Anyway, after we got off of the base camp with its 15 mpH speed  limit, it was on. It will go 0-60 in about 10 seconds, which is pretty  respectable for a truck that weighs over 5 tons.     Mounted on the sides of the truck are combat  indentification panels. They are rippled sheet metal panels about 2 inches thick  covered with reverse polarity thermal tape. I hate them because they rattle when  the engine idles. My plan was to come back to the camp short at least one CIP.  And some new white paint in a few spots wouldn't hurt either. I'm telling you,  turn me loose in a city with no traffic laws with an armored truck and  it's  on like a soup bone .     For the first half of the trip, trying to run  someone off the road or into something was fruitless. These Iraqi drivers are  agile little bastards. So for the second half of the trip, I just settled for  intimidating people. Things like riding 2 inches off of their bumper, swerving  from one side to the other so as to take up the entire freeway, or just rolling  through crowded city streets where there is just enough space for the Humvee to  squeeze through at 30 mpH. I had fun. Sadly, my luitenent won't let me drive  anymore. He thinks I went crazy and was trying to kill someone. But he's wrong.  I'm just shy of crazy as long as I am on my medication. I am trying to kill  someone, though.     When we got back to the barracks an hour and a  half&nbsp;later, my driver was already back. I told him&nbsp;that the truck  needs new shocks like the Hindenberg needed a fire extinguisher and that the  anti-sway bar on those trucks need to be about 6 sizes bigger, but other than  that, it's just a heavy truck. Upon inquiring why he was back so soon, he told  me that they had made a mistake. The concert was at 10 in the  morning . He  was a little upset, but he'll pull through. He's one of the two best soldiers in  this company. He's one ofmy soldiers.            \",\n",
       " \"                          I realized today that there are a few things that I  have left out of some of my previous posts.      Two things - the trip over here and my orientation  briefing when I got here - I will publish complete posts for. They will be back  dated so as to fit into the other posts chronologically, so you will need to  scroll down a bit in order to get to them.      As for the other additions, I will publish them  here in this post so they will be easily located. In addition, I will edit the  prevesious posts so as to reflect these changes. In the process, I will&nbsp;be  editing the previous posts for typograpgical, grammatical, literral,  chronological, and technical errors. I realized I have not been running the  spellchecker before I posted, so I will copy everything into MS Word so that it  can tell me how bad I type. In the future, I will type everything in MS Word  before I post them, so this should be the only time I do this. I will also be  modifying some posts for security reasons. (it now occurs to me that there are  benifits of this kind of journal I did not originally see)     When I am done editing, I will remove this post. At  that time I suggest you read the whole enchilada  one mo' gen .So without  further ado, let's dive in.      &nbsp;    --------      &nbsp;    About an hour before we rolled out the first time  to try to catch the mad mortarman, Freaky came by with a new addition to our  arsenal. Courtesy of the Army supply system, we now have Lasergrips from Crimson  Trace for our M9 9mm Berretta Pistols. They are relatively easy to install, but  we had to do it quickly so that we could roll out to our mission with them. All  you need is a flathead screwdriver to remove the plastic factory handgrips. Then  you place the included metal plate over the hole in the magazine well on the  right side so that the batteries don't fall into the magazine well, place the  two included quarter dollar sized batteries on the plate,&nbsp;install the new  grips onto the sides of the pistol, and place a little treehugger laser warning  decal underneath the sliderail. When you are done, the pistol looks stock save  for the rubberized grips, the tiny switch on the bottom of one of the handguard,  and the small bump protruding from the top of the right handgrip. The little  switch allows you to turn the system off when the weapon is stored so as to  prevent accidental battery drainage. Now, when you grip the pistol a laser beam  shoots beside the barrel out of that little bump on the side.     We've always had intimidating equipment. Some  examples: The Iraqis learned very quickly that although our Humvees are of  relatively small size they are uparmored and weigh a little ove 5 tons, which is  more than capable of pushing an Opel out of the way. When we are stopped in an  area in order to do something on the ground,&nbsp;often the locals start to  gather around the truck in order to converse, advise, beg, or try to sell  something to one of us. If they get to a point that someone feels that our  perimeter could be compromised, nothing clears the area better than charging a  shotgun. The LaserGrips are another exellent addition to that list.     While we were out there that night, we parked  quietly in a little wooded grove near our objective. We were trying to covert  (or as covert as you can with uparmored Humvees) when a man came peeking out of  his gate to see what was going on. You would not believe how quickly he ran away  when he noticed my red dot on his head. It also works well with dogs. They hate  lasers in their eyes.      &nbsp;    --------      &nbsp;    This blog will be available&nbsp;for everyone to  read, but I am primarily writing it towards Venus.

I do  desparately need at least one single check  as soon  as&nbsp;possible . I guess I failed to convey this in the manner in  which it deserved, but I cannot convey the utmost urgency of my need of that  check. I plead to you now to do whatever it takes to get that in the mail with  ultimate priority.     - Snacks. Do not send doritos. I don't know why I  put that down. I can get doritos in the chow hall. What I cannot get is torrilla  chips and chili con queso.     - Feel free to send pictures via e-mail. I have  decent bandwith now and would love some pictures.     - Handcuffs, batons, etc...     - Whetstone. The only one I have here is 3/4 inch  by 1 1/2 inch.

       " \"                          I was awakened about 1200 because we had been  alerted. Now I have a problem with being on QRF. It was all fine and good as  long as it did not effect my sleep. This was the second time in 24 hours. First  the SAS needs  backup,  now we have to go down to the local gas station  because there were reports of a disturbance over the (tell me&nbsp;if this makes  any sense) gas shortage.      There has been this gas shortage for the last few  days because of a broken line somewhere. The gas station about&nbsp;10 miles  down the road from our camp is one of the few in the city that are still open  for business. We were dispatched there the day before yestarday because the  owner was afraid of the crowd. He said that he had been getting threats when he  closed for the night. I would be upset, too, if I had waited in line for an hour  to get gas and he closed up shop on me.      By the time we got there today, the IP's already  had it under control. Oh well, back to camp.     We got back around 1300. That gave me 30 minutes to  get to the chow hall for some much deserved lunch. It was good, too. BBQ ribs,  corn on the cob, beans, and a salad.

       " \"                          I'll start this off by introducing myself.  My full name's Loo Li Ling Jenna, which i've always found weird, seeing as how normal babies would be baptised Jenna Loo Li Ling, if they were going to be named that at all. Of course, if your parents didn't like the name Jenna, but preferred, say, Mary, well, then they would name you Mary Loo, or whatever your surname was. And if you were as unfortunate as to be born a boy, why, then you'd be named neither Mary nor Jenna but some masculine name like Kevin or Nebuchanezzer.            Now you may be thinking that my entries are going to be super long, seeing as how i took up a whole paragraph telling you my name. It reminds one of Treebeard, and Entish. I'll make the rest of it snappy.           I have shoulder length black hair, with dark brown eyes and brown spectacles. I'm about 162 cm tall, and am pretty tanned. I go to SMK Sri Permata, where i love to eat the fresh watermelon that the nice canteen lady sells. Oh yeah, i'm going to be 16 in August.           Why 'No Apologies'? I just came back from the No Apologies Camp my church ran in Peacehaven, Genting, where i learnt about love, life, and sex. A lot of question that i had inside of me, about relationships, love, and the like were answered at the camp. How far can one go with a guy, and all that.            No Apologies . That's what i'll aim for. I'll live my life with that in mind. I guess the one truth that stood out most  for me was abstinence (from premarital sex) really gives you freedom. Freedom from STDs( sexually transmitted diseases), unwanted pregnancy, emotional damage. I'll be free to save myself for the one guy i'll spend the rest of my life with. Don't you think it's so beautiful and special that you have one gift that you can save for your spouse?             No Apologies . I will never apologise for sticking to God's Word. I know there will be many, many instances when it will be easier to lie, or to leave someone to their own problems. Many times when doing the right thing will cause people to hate me.  No apologies.           Angelic, huh? Hey, there are many things i've struggled with. There is one thing that i haven't completely overcome yet. That one thing has caused me to fall from God so many,many,many times before. When will i have the final victory? I do it, and ask for forgiveness, and then i do it again. The only way i'll ever get over it is by getting strength from Jesus. He forgives me readily, He loves me completely, and I know i'll never be alone again. Still knowing and feeling are sometimes two completely different things.  Love, Jenna  p.s. my old blog was  urlLink www.xanga.com/jenna_loo                        \",\n",

       " \"                          I've been wondering where my Father was for quite some time now. It had been two years since I had the money and the courage to go to him. I had visited him in North Carolina where he had retired as Gunery Sgt for the Marines.He had a girlfriend at the time whom I didn't like because of her style and her voice, it was so hoarse and scratchy like.But anyway I had receive a call last month, he was telling me he was going to see my grandmother first, whom resides in L.A. Then he was going to take Greyhound and see me here in the city. I knew I couldn't truly depend on him to come when he told me, he would be in on a certain day like a Monday. Instead he comes to visit me four days later and I appreciated that. During his whole week here I didn't have much time with him because I was working and I couldn't get out of work because he came in at short notice.        Whatever moments we had together were great, I mean I love my Dad very much even though he doesn't visit or call as often, he is my dad. Anyway when he came and the precious time I had with him. We went to the movie theater and we saw the Brad Pitt flick, 'Troy'. We also went to a bookstore together and I bought this novel called 'The Lovely Bones' by Anne Sebold. It's a poignant novel, by the way. It's about a girl murdered watching everything and everyone she loved on earth in heaven.         My dad told me that he is willing to pay for my trip to see my other relatives and half siblings in the Philippines if I get my passport soon. I told him I wanted to come but the timing is so bad now. I need to finish school.On his last day since he would be missing Father's Day in San Francisco. I decided before he went back to L.A. to see my grandmother. I would treat him to some sushi at my favorite restuarant, Warakubune. I ended up spending a lot but it was worth it, my dad is  my dad. I love him no matter what. One of the  my best memorries is when we were doing laundry together. Even my mother was with us that day, they are still friends sort of. But anyway I got my lesson on folding pants by the sides so that they won't wrinkled. My dad, Mr. I-Always-Have-To- Right gave me his typical lecture. I didn't mind I don't see him as often as  I like to, I am too independent.I guess something as simple as doing laundry can bring out the love for my father.        That night I saw him leave for Greyhound even though there were other passengers that smelled and reek of bad hygiene. We both laughed about it and then we said our goodbyes. He left for his bus, I rode down the escalator to catch a cab.       It's been over one month since he departed for that bus and no matter what future holds in our father-daughter relationship, I still love my dad.      \",\n",

In some countries this is  already standard.&nbsp;In my&nbsp;second year of Japanese residence, this  feature was added to the alien resgistration cards. I remember feeling slightly  like a criminal as I stood there having my prints taken. (I don't know if  Japanese nationals have fingerprints on theirs). However, in retrospect, it was  more like stamping something with your chop as it wasn't a&nbsp;complete  'fingerprinting'. In Korea, my prints were taken&nbsp;properly (although not  reproduced on my card).       &nbsp;       Many Taiwanese are against having their prints on  thier ID card. Recently there has been a scandal over a personal data leak.  Financial agencies and credit investigation agencies leaking personal  date;&nbsp;government investigation agencies bugging telecommunications lines  and searching records... and law enforcement agents abusing power by selling  data gleaned. I am still not sure exactly how and to what extent the 'victims'  suffered losses... but they are demanding compensation. There are some calling  up just to find out if they were victimized without their knowledge. Anyway,  people are now asking how they can give&nbsp; their fingerprints to a government  that cannot prevent data leaks.        &nbsp;    Although Taiwan, like much of Asia, is somewhat  cash oriented, the use of credit cards is already more widespread than in other  countries.&nbsp;Many of my Taiwanese&nbsp;have as many as 5 or 6 (they can shift  their debt from one to the other each month to avoid paying any interest). But  what happens when all of society goes plastic and you can pay directly out of  your account as in North America... and&nbsp;a&nbsp;NEC sensor that read prints  directly from your digits rather than relying on ink prints is used as the ID  method rather than a password (the police in Japan&nbsp;is now using this system  of IDing)... or when all personal data is contained on one biometric 'smart  card'?

Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. A Maoist insurgency, launched in 1996, has gained traction and is threatening to bring down the regime. In 2001, the Crown Prince massacred ten members of the royal family, including the king and queen, and then took his own life. In October 2002, the new king dismissed the prime minister and his cabinet for 'incompetence' after they dissolved the parliament and were subsequently unable to hold elections because of the ongoing insurgency. The country is now governed by the king and his appointed cabinet, which has negotiated a cease-fire with the Maoist insurgents until elections can be held at some unspecified future date.

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting for 40% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Security concerns in the wake of the Maoist conflict and the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US have led to a decrease in tourism, a key source of foreign exchange. Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in hydropower and tourism, areas of recent foreign investment interest. Prospects for foreign trade or investment in other sectors will remain poor, however, because of the small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness, its landlocked geographic location, its civil strife, and its susceptibility to natural disaster. The international community's role of funding more than 60% of Nepal's development budget and more than 28% of total budgetary expenditures will likely continue as a major ingredient of growth.

       " \"                          Learning Curves   I'm starting to understand a little better what it means to have order in my life.  I wake up each morning now and I am at Zero, there is no negative balance to account for, and anything I do that is productive pays off right away.  Whatever I do is already successful because the problems are already dealt with.  I feel great now right after getting out of bed.   It's such a great way to start the day.  I was talking to my friend Luis tonight and he mentioned something he's discovered lately that really put things in perspective for me.  He was wondering what it was he was really working for.  If he makes his millions (which is similar to what I was wanting up till a few weeks ago) he plans to do what?  Nothing!  He wants to be able to sit around and do nothing.  And I started to realize that I had a very similar thinking.  I wanted to work hard so that some day I could stop working.  But when I finally put that into context with the fact that I get miserably upset and depressed when I do nothing, I discovered that like Luis I've been setting myself up for a bad time.  The irony is that lately I've started shifting my view of personal rewards.   My reward system has mostly been based on what other people think of me.  I do enough artwork to keep people visiting my site.  I do enough work to produce a comic for a convention.  I do enough to say that I've been doing something.  But not enough to truly be successful.  And in all of those instances it's so easy to fail, because if people don't respond the way I envision, then the reward falls flat on its ass.    My reluctance with doing caricatures had a lot to do with that flawed reward system.  I have this uncanny ability to track and estimate the amount of money that I can make at each show.  I could often do that with my comic books too.  But the problem was that with the caricatures my skills weren't at the level needed to do it professionally.  So the traffic was there and the estimates would have been right, except it took 1,000 times too long for me to meet the demand.  So it was perpetual frustration.  Both at the loss of revenue and at my lack in skill.  So this time around I'm keeping it simple, I'm charging half what I normally would and I'm shying away from estimating profits.  Instead my reward is learning the craft, and perfecting it.  At some point I will be at the speed that I need and the skill required to meet the demand, and at that point I can start estimating profit margins again.  But I have to put in the time first and set the proper rewards to motivate myself.  I'm thinking on a daily basis now instead of a monthly or yearly one.  I'll be a millionaire 'one minute' at a time.  This discipline stuff isn't too hard.  It's all about actively living each day.  And doing it for the right reasons.    --Will                       \",\n",

The mortars aren't doing any damage, they  are just annoying. So they have us set in a concealed area near where they think  the guy is launching them from, in order to hear them and then give chase (and  gunfire). We ended up setting out there for about 4 hours. I cannot begin to  express upon you the level of boredom I sunk to. However, it was nothing  compared to last night. We went out again, but used a slightly different method.  I still ended up sitting at my machine gun for another 3 or 4 hours. I thought  it was getting bad, but when higher told us to head back to base, they also told  us to prepare to go back out there in the wee hours of the morning. That only  gave us 3 hours to sleep, but I made the best of it.      When we went back out there, we were all tired. It  gets interesting trying to stay awake sometimes.

I will have nothing left that I don't actually use.  Then I'll start into my routines.  By the way, I'll be at the flea market on Clovis Hwy this weekend doing caricatures, if anyone in the Lubbock area wants to come by to get one drawn.  I'll probably spend the next few weeks at the flea market getting back into the groove again before I start doing fairs and festivals again.     urlLink      --Will                        \",\n",

But then again that photo was taken five years ago, alot had has happened since then.             My grandmother was making tamales at the time and I told her I was going to use the phone since I lost my cell phone and couldn't get a new one until August. Still I was feeling anxious and I wanted to see or hear Nick so badly. I told her not to disturbed me. I was either going to hear his voicemail or his voice.          I dialed those special seven numbers and waited to hear the other line, I was scared, I managed to hold my breathe and sure enough I heard his voice. He was glad to hear from me, he told me he was in Lake Tahoe and went to his uncle's bachelor party. There was a certain hesitation in his voice whaen I asked if he had a good time. I even asked how the weather was. Then I told him about work and he seemed worried when I said, 'I would be working on 4th of July and not only that celebrating my mom's 47th birthday.' Then we talked about family and yada yada yada, you get the point. There is still so much to talk about and in the climatic phone call, I asked he would like to meet up at The Hard Knox Cafe, near his workplace and have lunch and he said sure. Then we hung up the phone and I was overwhelmed. In my mind, I wanted to play a Franz Ferdinand song, 'Take Me Out'. The video is cool and yet the song is catchy. I was finally going to meet Nick K. on Thursday. I jumped up and down like a little kid a a candy store, I was excited.      \",\n",

       " \"                          THE EUCHARIST AS MOLDING US INTO COMMUNITY   by Rev. Ron Rolheiser, OMI  There is a story told about a Jewish farmer who, because he was carelessness, had to spend a Sabbath day in his field. Preoccupied with his work, he had let the sun go down without going home. Now, being a pious believer, he was not allowed to travel until sunset the next day. So he spend the day in the field, by himself, missing both the Seder meal with his family and the services at the synagogue. When he finally did return home the next evening, he was met by an irate wife and an equally upset Rabbi. The Rabbi chided him for his carelessness and asked him: 'What did you do in the field by yourself all day? Did you at least pray?'   'Rabbi,' the farmer answered, 'I'm not a very smart man and I don't know many prayers. All the prayers I knew, I said in five minutes. What I did the rest of the day was simply recite the alphabet. I left it up to God to make some words out of all those letters.'   We leave it to God to make the words out of the alphabet of our lives. There are few better ways to describe how the Eucharist works in terms of forming us into one heart in Christ. The Eucharist, as we know, is meant to form us into one body in a way that takes us beyond the differences and divisions of personality, ideology, theology, gender, ethnicity, history, social status, pre-occupation, privatized agenda, and jealousy. Often times it alone has the power to do this. Why? Why does the Eucharist have such unique power?   The Eucharist creates community in a way that cannot be explained in terms of normal group-process. Only the language of ritual sheds any light here. What happens at the Eucharist cannot be extrapolated and explained in terms of simple psychological dynamics. It transcends the purely psychological, as does all powerful ritual process. How? An analogy might be helpful in trying to understand this:   I entered the Oblate seminary in my late teens as part of a group of nearly fifty young men (with an average age of under twenty-five). We were housed in one small, over-crowded building which also served us for classrooms, library, cafeteria, and recreation. I lived in that situation, a potential psychological hot-bed, for six years and, overall, it was a wonderful experience. Despite our differences in background and personality and our youthful immaturities, we basically got on quite well with each other. Very few left the seminary, in those years, over relational difficulties with other seminarians.   However, one of the linchpins within our daily program was something we called 'Oraison'. It worked this way: For half an hour each morning and for another half-hour each night, we would sit together, all of us, in complete silence in the chapel. No words were exchanged among us and nothing was expected of anyone except his silent presence. Looking back now, I see that this particular practice of sitting together in silence, in prayer, for an hour each day, did more to bring us together and keep us together than did all the community-building exercises we did at other times. It created a ritual container that held us together in a way that no purely psychological or emotional container ever can. What we had each day was akin to a 'Quaker silence'; we sat together, before God, and asked God to give us something that we could not give to ourselves, namely, community beyond our differences. We asked God to make a single word out of the different letters of our lives.   And it wasn't anything romantic, you can be sure of that! We sat in a chapel, which itself was no aesthetic prize, as a group of immature, young men, and we fought sleep, boredom, our hormones, tiredness, low-sugar, irritation with each other, full moons, growling stomachs, homesickness, emotional obsessions, scars from our sporting events, and jealousies. This wasn't the holy family, not by a long shot. But it worked - marvellously so. God gave us, daily, something we couldn't give to ourselves, a common heart and common spirit. So too, in Eucharist.   Recently I saw a satirical version of Leonardo de Vinci's famous Last Supper. Mostly it looked like the original, except, in this updated version, one of the disciples is making a phone call on a mobile phone, just as Jesus is lifting the bread and wine to God for consecration. Not far off the mark at all!   One of our deepest, congenital longings is for community. But we come together, seeking each other, carrying huge differences: our wounds, our separate histories, our preoccupations, our sexual and emotional obsessions, our jealousies, our boredom, and (far too often) our cellular telephones. Such is our alphabet. On our own we cannot form ourselves into a single prayer or into a single heart. Only God can make those words. God does this for us in the Eucharist.           \",\n",
       " \"                          The MIG's have been backbone of Indian Air Force since long time. Their performance is well proved in four wars we fought with Pakistan. But today the fleet is ageing. The manufacturer of the aircraft i.e. Soviet Union no longer exists. During the regime of Soviet union, they had extensive manufacturing and research facilities to develop the MIG series of fighters. But eversince disintegration of Soviet Union these facilities are their but have degraded a lot in their quality. Present Russian government can't afford to secure enough funds for upkeep of these facilities. The result is clear. We get defective spare parts from Russia, which is the main reason why these planes are coming down day by day. So many years have passed by after our independence from British, but India is still in its infancy for Aircraft technology. Our own indeginous fighter is still to be come out of the development process. Other projects like Advanced Light Helicopter and Arjun Main Battle Tank are also not complete. We still rely on western countries for critical parts of these warmachines like their engines. I don't understand India with a population of more than one billion talented people can't develop its own war machines? After second world war world is divided into two parts, pro-americans and pro-soviets. India was offered a deal by both U.S. and Soviets. U.S. wanted India to allow land its troops on Indian soil and give them a permanent base. But India was reluctant to lose its sovereignity and become a pet nation of a superpower. So India opted for Soviet Union which did not put any such condition. So then U.S. turned to Pakistan and India was backed by Soviet Union. Thus Soviet Union became major arms supplier to India. Here India lost the battle since U.S. is far superior in terms of military equipment than Soviet Union. So if India had struck the deal with U.S., F16's would have been our backbone force rather than the MIG's. Also U.S. would not have supported Pakistan due to which it dared to fight against us in 1965 and 1972. History can't be altered but future can be. India must built special Institutions and R&D facilities to develop its own military arsenals. India must hunt down talented people from its large human resource and employ them in such institutions to develop 100% indeginous military equipments. This will not only reduce dependence of India on developed countries for these equipments but also save a lot of foreign exchange. We can also sell these equipments to other countries and earn foreign exchange for our country. If we are strong in military power, no neighbouring country will ever dare to start any war against us. Developed countries will also respect our presence in world community and soften their stands on various economic issues like GATT.      \",\n",

Of course I cannot tell you what  we   are going to do, but I can tell you what  I  am going to do. I am going  to shoot some miscreant in the face. We should finally see some action. The sad  part about it is that we will not be alone.

The funny thing is  that&nbsp;Dave,&nbsp;Joel,&nbsp;Drunk Mike, Freaky and I&nbsp;were just two days  ago sitting in the chow hall&nbsp;recounting fond memories of past experiences  in this fine Army. We sat and talked for several hours, even as the place closed  around us, each giving his best recollection of our more interesting times. When  all was said and done, we departed. As we lit&nbsp;began the&nbsp;43 mile trek  back to the barracks, we continued to smoke and joke until Joel said those  famous words, 'I remember when we used to be tankers.'      As I sit here,&nbsp;I am typing on one half of the  screen and watching the greatest tanker movie of all time:  The Beast.  I  cannot wait until that most&nbsp;glorious of days when I make my triumphant  return to my tank.     On&nbsp;a lighter note, the fiasco that is my  promotion is finally starting to look as if it will be handled. All that I am  waiting for now is the documents that I need to complete the reconstruction of  my promotion packet. That will be great.     I have a new request for supplies:      - Desenex Foot and Sneaker Deodarant     - OD Green 100 mpH tape     - Game Cube and accesories     - A new memory card for the Game Cube     - Mertoid Prime 2 for the Game Cube (It should come  out around Christmas)     I will finally have enough space for a Game Cube  since we will be moving into our new barracks Saturday. Since we will be leaving  this toilet of a barracks soon, I am going to document every little cramped,  decrepit inch of it. The pictures should be posted on Yahoo! soon.     The company should start rotating back to the  states a few at a time every couple of weeks starting at the end of June. I have  been slated to fly out on the next to last flight, which should be toward the  end of our tour if we get to go at all.     This morning I went to sleep around 2 am. I was up  for a while because we did not get back from our evening mission until about  1130 at night. I was for some reason thinking we were going to leave this  evening, so in preparation, I typed everything up until this paragraph. I am now  typing while waiting in line to access the internet. I cannot tell you how glad  I will be when I get to move into a real room with hot and cold running  internet.     By the time I went to sleep, I was not worried  about being tired because I figured I could just take a nap after our morning  mission. We had to be up at 0415 and it was my turn to wake up the platoon. I  did some quick thinking and realized that even though I was going to be dead to  the world 2 hours later when it would be time to wake up, I could still wake the  rest of the platoon up. I simply used Windows Scheduling Service to access  an&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;In a Hurry to Get Things Done  Mp3 file at 0415, set  the volume up all the way, and placed my laptop up above my bunk on the ledge so  that only I could get to it. Sure enough, I had three people waking me up at  0415. They were not happy, but at least they were up.     Our task this morning was a simple escort mission  followed by a 'Mosque Monitoring' mission. We dropped the Commo guys that we  were escorting off at Camp Ironhorse, and proceeded directly to our favorite  mosque. We were there by 0600, so we hid the Humvees in the same place that we  have in the past, just down the road from the mosque. We were expecting morning  prayers to start at 0700. What we do is simple: we listen. First, the Imam  prays, then he invites everyone else to the mosque to pray, gives a little  speech, prays again, and it's over. All of this is blasted from LOUDspeakers  mounted on the top of those funny looking towers. We have an interpreter with us  who takes notes on what the Imam is saying, plus we record it onto an Mp3  recorder using a mic clip clipped to one of the antennas of the tank. We are  listening for anti-coalition sentiment being broadcast. Yessiree, Bob. Operation  Iraqi Fascism.      We sat there for a couple of hours and the prayers  never started. I didn't know what had happened, but I really did not care  anyway. I was tired. When we got back to base camp, all we had to do was clean  our weapons, reorganize and check the load plan, and perform preventive  maintenance checks and services on the truck. I planned on being done in an  hour. That was before all hell broke loose. I won't go into details about why I  have been BUSY since 0800 this morning, but it involves a new tie rod end and  enough ammunition to take over a small country.     That's about it for now.

       " \"                          We had a different kind of mission today. We had to  escort the S-4 ( S taff officer # 4  - Logistics)&nbsp;to BIAP  ( B aghdad  I nternational  A ir p ort). They had a load of  new equipment to pick up, and they cannot leave by themselves because driving  through Baghdad in the middle of the day without at least 4 or 5 machine guns  mounted on the tops of vehicles is just a little past insane. It was interesting  because originally I was scheduled to report to the S-4 at 0630 in order to load  up on&nbsp;the truck so that I could go to BIAP with them so that I could draw  my RFI issue. RFI stands for 'Rapid Fielding Initiative'. It is a process that  is used when the Army decides to purchase some new equipment for the troops and  wants to field it quickly. We are getting issued new ammo pouchs that attach  flat to our body armor (much better than the bulky, floppy things I have now),  new &amp; improved green boot socks, silk underwear (very comfortable in this  heat, I hear), 4 new pair of boots - 2 summer, 2 winter (also getting rave  reviews), 'assault packs'- camouflage&nbsp;backpacks with MOLLE attachment  points to put ammo pouches and what not on it with a built-in Camelback bladder  (very handy), and loads of other nifty stuff. I say WE are getting, but  actually, everyone else already has thiers, I'm just late getting into  country.     As it turned out though, are platoon  got&nbsp;assigned to escort this convoy to BIAP. We also had to supply the  truck. We coordinated to use our company supply truck, but First Sergeant would  only send the driver for it. So I got tapped to command the truck since I was  the highest ranking person without my own truck. At first I was aprehensive  because that truck will only do 50 mpH going downhill, which is also a little  risky. But since the truck was recently uparmored with 2.5 tons of hardened  steel plate and multi-layer ballistic glass, I felt relatively at  ease.     When we got to BIAP, we first went to the big PX  there to eat some Burger King. Then my luitenant took me over to the RFI  building, which by the way was right next to one of the largest palaces I've  seen so far. It was currently being used as the III Corps HQ. The line going  into the building was staggering. I asked someone who works there how long it  would take to get through the line. He said that we had picked a very bad day to  come.&nbsp;According to him, it would take 3 hours just to get into the  building. Since we had to leave at 1300, they decided&nbsp;to take me back here  some other day. I was glad they said that.&nbsp;I did not feel like standing in  the sun for 3 hours. It's alright anyway, since none of the stuff they are  issuing is mission dependant. It's basically upgraded versions of what&nbsp;I  have already. I can wait a few days.     We ended up loading the truck up and leaving at the  predesignated time, but not before spending a little time at the MWR (Morale,  Welfare, and Recreation) tent they had at BIAP. Plus I got to get another burger  from Burger King. That beats lunch at the chow hall any day. Mission  Accomplished.            \",\n",

Having come straight from work, I was already looking considerably less than  salsa-sexy!&nbsp; I ran to the nearest shop ( Mango ) to find a quick replacement. As Taiwan  stocks only smaller sizes... and being as a few years in Taiwan (everything  tastes better with a little pork fat, you know?)&nbsp;has increased my dress  size, my options are limited.&nbsp;5 minutes later and with my wallet  considerably lighter, I run to Patio to see if G is there yet. She isn't. The  host leads me to my table. We descend into a sunken retro pit! She shows me to  my circular gray fuzzy chair with a view of the geometric white balastrades and  the light patterns being projected on the ceiling. She also informs me that the  live salsa band won't start until 10:00- an hour later than advertised! (On weeknights, every hour is precious)       &nbsp;    G arrives and we order. The food was only mediocre, the prices were what I have come to expect in Taipei, but the  service... Well I would really like to know what the service charge was for! Not  only did the waiter repeatedly give the wrong dish to the wrong person and  forget to bring us various necessary items, he dropped food in my friend's lap  when clearing the table. Hmmm...      &nbsp;    Anyway, 10:00 arrived (as did many of our 'salsa  friends') and we moved into the red lounge area to hear the 'live salsa band'.  Hmmm... (again). In the first set, the band did not play a single salsa song!  They started with&nbsp;a love balad, then&nbsp;a cumbia number, followed by cha  cha cha and a Ricky Martin cover! We were actually looking forward to the band  taking a break so we could have some salsa.... but it turns out the DJ didn't  have even 1 salsa CD! Salsa Party indeed!

       " '                          Well, my poor dad. This morning, while I was still asleep my mom took my dad to the emergency room. Oy. Well dad’s head has been hurting a lot, and he’s a guy who doesn’t complain when he is hurt or sick. Well his ear has really been bothering him and his throat has been sore. He even went to the doctor and got medication. Well anyway yesterday his face and lip started to go numb and he passed it off as nothing. Today one half of his face went totally numb and limp. So they went to the emergency room and the doctor said it was Bell’s Palsy, which isn’t really serious. They don’t have much medication for it and it could go away in a couple days or a couple months. So we’ll hope it goes away soon. Mom and I drove up to Greenville to get a recliner from my grandma(1) for dad to sleep in since he’s having trouble sleeping.  And, exciting and scary, I drove for about a half hour on the way back, from Greenville, it’s about a 45 minute drive. So it was fun...I guess, kinda. I went on a bike ride around my block and I was riding with no hands on the handle bars. My block has lots of cul-de-sac and as I was going around and there was a little gir,l standing in her driveway. And her eyes got soooo wide, her jaw was dropped! It was really funny, as I just went around the half circle with no hands on the handle bars. I laughed afterward, a lot. tehehehe. Oh, by the way, if you’ve never ridden on your bike with no hands on the handle bars don’t go out and do it. I mean, don’t start out on your bike and take your hands off the handle bars all of a sudden. That’s what I did at first. Ok, well I was riding my bike and I saw these guys ride past with no hands on the handle bars. Well I immediately took my hands off the handle bars. Now I didn’t fall flat on my face, luckily, I kinda fell off the seat and landed standing up. It still hurt tho. So I tried it again on another bike ride, I took my hands off the handle bars for a few seconds at the time until I got the hang of it. Now I can ride standing up, legs braced, and ride with no hands on the handle bars....that’s at the same time. :-) So I’ve come a long way. Yeah, well...that’s about it and I better go to bed now, because it’s kinda late and...yeah, I need my sleep. So...night! *Runs away, tail swishing*      ',\n",

       " \"                          What is the language of love? Some say love needs  no language... or that between two people who are meant to be together, no  language beyond the language of love is needed.&nbsp;Are we to understand  that&nbsp;this language is made up up entirely&nbsp;of glances, gestures, and  other non-verbal kinds of communication?&nbsp;It    all seems very romantic, but I wonder...       &nbsp;    Recently I attended a birthday party for a  Spanish-speaking&nbsp;student celebrating with 50 of his closest friends and his  Japanese girlfriend. She sat leaning against him for most of the early part of  the evening. She spent most on the evening just sitting, only occasionally  punctuating her silence to chat with her girlfriends in Japanese, or to look at  bf with big doe eyes and exchange a few kisses. I asked her if she was studying  Spanish or English... but she said she wasn't - only Chinese... well, this is  Taiwan after all... but neither is he studying Japanese (and she admits she  can't understand his Chinese). Seeing as there really is no common spoken  language they can share, that chemistry must be pretty strong and the language  of love speaking volumes...&nbsp; Certain he said volumes after a bottle of  champagne when he stood up and declared his love for her to the whole room.  Hmmm....      &nbsp;    How important it is to share a language with your  partner? Who should learn whose language... or should the couple both learn the  other's language... or a third/neutral language? Or&nbsp;is it different for  everyone? Are there people who really can communicate without language?        &nbsp;    I remember my first year in Korea. I guess most  people who have lived in a foreign country have had the experience of going on a  few dates with someone who doesn't share&nbsp;their language. I remember the  pleasure and pride of stringing together a sentence and having it be understood  by the other party... drawing pictures, charts and diagrams to make  communication... How flattering it feels when someone has made the effort to  learn a few words/phrases in your language.       &nbsp;    I also remember how frustrating it was not to be  able&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn fast enough... repeatedly try to explain something and  the frustrations mounting to a point where&nbsp;one just has to giggle and give  up... And the profound disappointment on having&nbsp;the achievement  of&nbsp;having sucessfully reached a certain proficiency in the target language  marred by the realization that&nbsp;not only do you have absolutely nothing in  common with your sweetheart... he stands for everything you are against! Hmmm...  ok, maybe it is not always so extreme, but for me... communication is extremely  important.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    I have more to say about this, but I will hold off  until I can update you on the saga of the above birthday boy... Perhaps I will  be able to report that she has learned fluent Spanish from  his&nbsp;friends,&nbsp;that his Japanese is coming right along, and they have  already&nbsp;started&nbsp;teaching their unborn baby Chinese, Japanese, Spanish  AND English.       &nbsp;    Well, this is too long so I will stop here, but  perhaps one day we can also share ideas on  love and language  exchanges .       &nbsp;    &nbsp;            \",\n",

       " \"                          Woke up about an hour ago, I think sleeping is righting itself in a proper way, slowly, but it's happening. I woke up after a dream I had about the ocean. I'm always dreaming about the ocean, lots of different ocean themes cross over my sleepy mind. This one, a set of large waves were coming in, and an extremely foolish woman was trying to ride her horse out into the surf. The swells were increasing, the horse would drown soon, I knew. I swam up to her, and tried to talk her out of what she was planning. She couldn't hear me, and in the fashion of many of my dreams, I talked to the horse. I told it how to swim under the waves as they crash, how it's important not to panic, and I told it I would go with it where ever it went, to help it swim. The horse got me to cover its nostrils as a wave began to break, it told me how hard it was to carry the foolish woman. The horse and I formulated a plan, it swam along the shoreline, rembering to duck under as the waves came, and to wait for them to pass before emerging for a breath. I swam alongside, out of sight from the rider, and timed it so when a wave was just about to crash over top of the horse and rider, I surfed it, and grabbed the rider, and pulled her off the horse, using the force of the ocean to acomplish this. The horse, now riderless, made its way inshore. As the rider and I got pulled into shore, I punched her in the face a few times, my dream self remembering Kurt telling me how a knockout is really only a case of whiplash. I knocked her out, pulled her away from the surf. The horse was standing on top of a dune, and I took off its bridle, halter, saddle. It galloped away, assuring me it would never get caught again. I turned back to the ocean to see the waves growing in size, and lessening in frequency. Perfect, thought my dream self, and I went back in to surf the waves.  It's peculiar. I feel I should be angry about something. I'm not exactly one to get angry, I get annoyed, and it's safe to say I get annoyed frequently, and in this state I'm most verbose about what exactly it is that's annoying me. But anger is something completely different, something one should be serious about, and life is much too important to be taken seriously. But right now, I feel I should be angry about something, there should be a righteous ire building in me, but it seems to me I must have forgotten what it was I was supposed to be angry about. I suppose I'm angry with the Rider from my dream, I'm angry at Garp for not being more understanding towards Helen in the book I'm reading. I keep on thinking about conversations Kurt and I have about where women stand in society (It's far worse than most would even suspect, and the scary thing is that it's practically invisible). I am angry at the fact that women are rarely taken as authorities on anything, how an assertive woman is a bitch, an open woman needy, and how, two years ago, a white, upper middle class woman, complained to the class i was in that she was being oppressed because there were too many men in her electrian's class, and she had to 'settle' for University. (wear a burqua, bitch, then talk to me about being oppressed. Don't get me wrong, women are not on par with men anywhere on this flavored little planet, but opression is not the proper term to use when talking about too many men in one place.)  But this anger is cerebral, distant and off to the side. I feel, oddly enough, that is should be closer to me, I should take the plight of the poor, women, and the other injustices to heart and become passionate with anger, and jump up and do something about the State of Things. I won't though. The more pragmatic side says that life does, in fact, suck, and getting angry does nothing. Nothing. It's a useless emotion, in and of itself, and there are many ways one can make their own corner of the world better. Feeling a duty to help people out, to be compassionate, I think that's the better way to go about things. Getting angry and distributing leaflets and other things will not change matters. Helping your neighbour out does. In a tiny way, of course, but everything's made up of tiny things, right?           \",\n",

You just want to be loved.  You really value your friends and your family, but more than anything, you value your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/person you are stalking.  You don't necessarily value yourself very much, but it's ok because you will find someone else to value you.

There's a long holiday weekend..No School till Wednesday... *ya hoo*  =P    Well the highlight of today's celebration was AJ race. It was fun but i fell along the way, on the concrete pavement outside MacDonalds near BIshan ITE. Suffered a few scratches on my palms,elbows and knees.. *Ouch*  *suay* -_-!!   Minor ones though..applied antiseptic already.. :) HeY!!! Our class was the first JC 1 class to complete the race!! Guess it was because we didnt had many stations and we were practically running thru out the race. When we returned to school we played 总集密码 while having milo and oreos. Hahaz.. this was the most fun game today. Miss Chan,Hui Zi, Michelle, ShiQi, JunJian, Boon Han, Zhi Qi, Diana did forfeits. They were really sporting. Esp Junjian, Shiqi and Boon Han Zhi Qi. Our class kinda scandaled them to do the forfeit in pairs. Each pair had to finish a bottle of water in 20 secs. Really fun. TOok many photos too. =P After the celebration we went for class lunch with Miss Chan. Not everyone went tho. Had lunch at Sukara Thai restaurant. Nice lunch. Found out quite some stuff about Miss Chan's past too. It seems that she's quite into sports too. HoneStly I admire her adventurous spirit in trying out so many various CCAs and activities.             As for how i am going to spend this rare long weekend holiday, i think i'll probably just stay home and catch up with work. There's lots to do and i'm really behind time in studies. I'm a little afraid for the upcoming CT and promo.. Grades have not been optimistic..Come to think of it there's not much time left either. Guess this makes it more crucial to catch hold of the remaining time.             CLDDS alumni is putting up a performance (drama) on 13th and 14th AUgust.. Tickets have not been selling well honestly, reckoned it's due to the clash of CT and probably because it's because it's put up by alumni and not students ourselves, so it's more difficult to persuade fellow friends to come support this event.                        Hahaz..hmn.. 'Singapore Idols' is going to be broadcast on NAtional Day.. wonder how our local talents are. Mom says it'll definitely disappoint me. I don not know. However i still believe that there'll be surprises. We shall wait and see.           GUess i'll stop here for today. HOpe my blog turns out nice!!                  \",\n",

Since you were recruited in the Philippines, we are going to fly you and your family back to that lovely subtropical island nation, BECAUSE THAT'LL SAVE THE NAVY SOME MONEY. If you choose to fly back to the States, you may do so, but you'll have to pay for your fare.  Billy Budd : What kind of crap is that? I'm talking to a Legal Officer!  (Ten minutes later, at the Legal Office)  The Master Gunnery Sergeant : You're correct indeed sir, that is pure, unadulterated crap. Tell whomever's handling your case that they had better unscrew themselves and fly you and your family back to the States at government expense.  Bily Budd : That's what I said!     (Later, at the Kadena Personnel Office)  Desk Jock Jim : I'm sorry, Billy, but my chiefs said that you have no other option.  Billy Budd : Well, I just spoke to a Marine paralegal officer that says otherwise.  Desk Jock Jim : Is that so? Well, put him on the phone and I'll talk to him. (While Billy Budd fumbles with the phone, Jenny Budd is confronted by the Chiefs)  Chief Jiminy : (leaning back on his chair)Sorry, Mrs. Budd, but them's da rules.  Jenny Budd : Look at me! I'm an American, for chrissakes! The Navy flew me in here, they oughta fly me out!  Chief Eerie : Calm down, ma'am...you made me pee my pants!  Chief Paradise : I need to talk to your husband, ma'am. Why don't you step out and call him in? (Enter Billy Budd)  Billy Budd : Let's look at this logically, Chief Paradise. You are about to send my wife and my kids, three American citizens by birth, to the Philippines. Don't get me wrong, they loved it the last we came over to visit, but they need to go home: TO THEIR HOME.     Chief Paradise : (shaking his head) The rules are clear, Billy.  Billy Budd : How could you be so myopic as to focus on the rules you keep citing, without even looking to see if it does apply to my situation? I spoke to a  Marine paralegal who says for you to check the...  Chief Paradise : (rudely interrupting)He's a goddamn Marine! What does he know about Navy rules?  Billy Budd : Last time I checked, (except for specific trivial cases) the Navy and the Marine Corps fall under the same rules.  Chief Paradise : No they don't. (Billy Budd steps out of the office and goes straight to the supervisor's office)  Billy Budd  (after presenting his case): ...and furthermore, you need to tell your Chiefs that that they were disrespectful to my wife.  The Master Chief : (in calm low voice) We will deal with that issue later. In the meantime, we'll take care of the crisis at hand. Tell me, what information did that Marine paralegal provide you?  Billy Budd : He said for you to look into the JFTR (Joint Federal Travel Regulations). (The Master Chief waves his hand at the Chiefs who scamper away. Minutes later, they come back with a copy of the JFTR.)  Chief Paradise : Y-you were right, Billy Budd. The JFTR clearly states that it is our responsibility to fly you and your family back to the United States, at government cost. I apologize for the misunderstanding. I didn't know about this JFTR.  Chief Jiminy : Neither did I. I'm sorry, Billy Budd. It won't happen again.  Chief Eerie : Out of curiosity, why are you getting out of the Navy?  Billy Budd : No disrespect, but that's none of your business, Chief! I didn't come here to make small-talk with you!  Chief Eerie : (in a whiny, mousy voice) Oh, no...I peed my pants again!  Billy Budd : (in a grim voice, to the Chiefs)You all need to apologize to my wife.  The Chiefs : (in unison) Oh, we will, we will! (scampers out.)  The Master Chief : You see, Billy Budd? Crisis averted. (draws a big sigh)And all this because Desk Jock Jim didn't know how to do his job.  Billy Bud : With all due respect, but neither do the Chiefs.  The Master Chief : I am painfully aware of that. It's a mistake, that's all. (The Chiefs return from groveling at Mrs. Budd's feet. At this point, Billy Budd assumes a cocky tone)  Billy Budd : I work in Medical. If I make a mistake, it could mean the death of a patient!  The Master Chief : True. Fortunately, here in Personnel, we do not deal with peoples' lives.  Billy Budd : Fortunately, indeed! Because with the level of competency that your staff showed today, there'd be a lot of dead patients here!  The Master Chief : Y-yeeees. (gestures at the Chiefs to start groveling again)  Chief Jiminy : A-again, we apologize.   Chief Paradise : Yes, yes. We apologize. We'll take care of your paperwork right now!  Chief Eerie : Would you and your wife like anything? Coffee? Tea? My pants?  Jenny Budd : Just get the paperwork rolling so we can get out of here! (Minutes later, Desk Jock Jim hands Billy Budd a new set of orders - this time, indicating that the entire family will be flown back to the States at government expense).  Desk Jock Jim : Again, we're sorry...  Billy Budd : Can it, bub. (The Budds walk away from the personnel office with smirks on their faces, savoring the small victory over bureaucracy, stupidity, and the Navy. The office building is left intact, but it might as well be razed to the ground, because the people who work inside it were beaten in their own game.)

       " '                          marylou is probably in her 40 ’ s and they just built and now own their first home ever. As you know miah and I just bought our first place to, so her and I have been talking about colors, decorations, etc.    I told her that I have always wanted a red kitchen, but can ’ t seem to find the right red as far as paint goes.    She told me that I should stop by after work to see her kitchen … it is red.    I really didn ’ t have a good excuse not to.    Miah was away, all I was going home to was an unfinished living room calling my name to finish painting it.    So I told her I would.                     She knows what miah and I are doing with River ’ s Edge and my background a little, so ever since then, she is eager to have me over and  “ talk Bible ”  as she says.    Fearful she would corner me into a conversation about the  ‘ bible ’ , I prayed on the way there and god told me he was on my side, so I knew then … I could do this.                     I get there and grandpa and her hubby were outside on the back porch, sitting there drinking some wine.    (huge Italian family)    marylou was peeling potatoes for dinner.    Her mother was over early and put a roast in for dinner. it was neat to see a family together like that.    It made me miss mine like CRAZY!    Marylou showed me around her place and then we went back outside to chat a little.    I fell in love with grandpa.    He was so chatty and cute.    He asked me most of the get-to-know-you questions people do.    I wanted to stay all night.    It was fun to hang out with a family again.    Marylou has two cute daughters, Erika and whitney.    They were there as well, and it was really nice.                     Marylou ’ s hubby, john, did ask the question, I will admit, is hard for me to answer sometimes … what does your husband do?    It is not that I don ’ t support what he does or that I don ’ t want to answer it, but it is so new to people, it can be hard to express/explain.    Plus I thought … this could start the  ‘ bible talk. ’     So I briefly mentioned what we did at MCC and how they sent us to start new churches in   manchester  .    Then they thought miah built churches.    If you think about it … we do … but they meant church buildings.    So I explained I little more in detail what river ’ s edge is all about.    They loved the idea.    I heard marylou say,  “ that is so fascinating. ”     And that was it.    Whew!    (I reread this and realized for some of you who haven ’ t been reading all my blogs … Marylou ’ s family are jehavoh witnesses)                 When I got there I noticed they had a parakeet.    It was just hanging out on the table (no cage) with the fam.    Eventually it jumped onto my lap.    My keys were sitting in my lap and it played with them for a while and then decided to crawl up my arm and sit on my shoulder.     Okay … this was a little crazy for me.    I had two of these birds growing up and I killed both.    Plus I didn ’ t know this bird … was it going to eat my ear off, poop on me … what?    Marylou asked if I was okay.    I smile and say …’ it is fine. ’     So we start chatting again and all of I sudden I hear this voice, but it wasn ’ t one of them.    it was too quick for me to figure out what it was, so I just ignored it and carried on in the conversation.    I heard it again … this time I understood what it said.    I was wicked confused, but still didn ’ t want to say anything.    Didn ’ t want them to think I was psycho.    The third time … I had enough.    I asked … does this bird talk?    They all started laughing.    It was a talking bird … but the problem was … no joke … it sounded like a truck driver.    Now what that sounds like … I don ’ t know, but that is the only thing I can compare it to.    When you think of these types of birds … they tend to have a high pitched chirping noise.    That was what throw me.    It would chirp high like they are suppose to, but when it talked … low, man, trucker voice.    It was the strangest thing.    John taught the bird to talk, so it mimics his low voice.    It said,  “ I am Ceasar (his name) ” ,  “ want some wine (the bird actually drank wine out of their glasses while I was there), and  “ look at me. ”     It has many things it says, but that was the only thing I got.                 Needless to say … I don ’ t know, but I like to think god used the bird to distract the conversation so we could just laugh together that night and hang out.    I know it will come where we will have the  “ bible talk, ”  but he knew.    He knew that I wasn ’ t comfortable going there and that I need support when it comes to conversations about theology and the bible with people like Jehovah witnesses.    I am as simple as it comes.    My faith is simple and I don ’ t get into the deep stuff/conversations like I should.    But that is where my hubby comes in.    he is geared up that way and we are a good team.    He helps me to think more deeply and I help him to stop making things so complicated and analyzing/thinking so much.    Heehee.                     I do look forward to our conversation one of these days.    god may your words come out of my mouth that day.                       ',\n",
       " \"                          my maternity leave (as sunil put  it) has lasted longer than i meant it to.&nbsp;it's a little over a week since i  put in a post.. and i'm feeling lousy about it. meanwhile so much has been  happening. im afraid i haven't got the time to catch up on it all..        &nbsp;     first things  first:  THEY'RE BACK! yeah yeah! my parents are back. and have been with  me now for over a week. how awesome is that!! it was lovely. their train got  here dot on time. (2 mins before schedule, rather) and i was there dot on time  to recieve them. them with their lots of suitcases. no changes in them all. the  same mama papa that i'd said tata to long long back. i was so happy, delighted,  relieved, glad, and every other nice thing in the world. now mom's back to her  work. she spoils me. i don't have to spend that much time in the office. i spend  all my mornings walking to the golden temple, gymming and wasting time. i also  spend some time with her.. in the workshop.       &nbsp;    that apart, she lovvvvvvved the  work i'd done :D awesme feeling. and my manager gave a nice report of me to her.  that i worked hard. spent a lottof time in the workshop everyday. took care. and  that -- sigh. awesome awesome!       &nbsp;     other - maybe - interesting  news  is that mr.consultant has become regular at calling up. for  therecord: mr.C has entered the picture as the friend of a friend. started  talking to him coz he was planning a trip to pondi. and then .. chatting  continued. the other day i was talking to my friend, and realised it'd been over  a year since i'd been talking to mr.C . and the story goes thus (facts first)  that he chats with me only when he is bored. during his exchange prog, he was  lonely. so he chatted. now in ahd, he gets lonely in the evening so he calls up.  sadly enough i don't seem to be able to talk to him .i feel dumb and  inarticulate. don't know what to say. somehow the conversation seems pretty one  sided. and this is quite a mutual feeling. he, infact, brought up this point in  a recent record length conversation. and i had to explanation. the accuation  went thus: and u have now gathered enough trivia about me to fill an entire  volume. and i know nothing about you.      &nbsp;    so tell me dear friends, what can i  talk about to him. he's travelled half the world (in the last year alone). he is  interested in 'fun'. god knows how i can relate to that. he thinks im limited in  my expression - or whatever.. and i know i'm limited in my exposure and  experiences. if i start talking about the pet dog i might soon get, he starts  tlaking about all the dogs he sawin germany, and all the dogs he wished had  since the age of 5. well, that's something not everyone would know about him.  but he's pretty yappy. so im sure that getting him to share stuff about himself  is not all that great an accomplishment. problem = don't know what to talk about  to him. when i last started discussing relationship issues about expectations  and misunderstandings, he couldn't relate. i can't talk about my work. the only  things i do talk about are very personal issues, regarding me, my family or my  friends. how can i even begin to share the whole perspective with someone else?  not only would it be unfair on my behalf, it would be practically impossible to  give him the context of my sob stories.       &nbsp;    in a very very very weird and  pathetic way, for just one tiny TINY fraction of a fraction, i wished i could  find someone like pk. at least there was no trouble relating to him at all.        &nbsp;     a HUG OF CONGRATULATIONS  and many happy feelings:      miss.TeaBagLady has now got through  her college of choice. the College of Arts. a biiiiig hug goes out to her. even  though i know she doesn't read this. the feeling's out there in the cosmos with  her name on it. may she get it when she needs it most!      &nbsp;    i'm going on a 'pilgrimage' this  weekend. walking up a hill to a temple and all that. for all i know it might be  raining. and there have been reports about mudslides. so people, pray for me.  and when i return, please keep some advice handy. and do do remember that i've  never even met mr.C.            \",\n",

       "\"             Ya, I'm off to Canada/Vancouver again soon...ah, to be back in the land of fresh air, real mountains and diapers. Luckily, I think my oldest boy is out potty-trained now. Not sure, though, haven't been home for about 2 months...and a lot can happen in that time.  Now that we've done a deal here my boss/CEO would have me here all of August (well, all of the year, actually) but I have to go back as it's my younger son's first birthday, or  urlLink 첫돌/Chot-dol  (they have a different name for almost everything here). For Koreans the 1st and 60th birthdays are the biggies. 1st because the child made it through the often-treacherous first year (remember, Korea used to be really, really poor...so much so that is was a 100-days celebration as well, but that is starting to become less important as more babies are living past it). 60th because the  urlLink Korean Zodiac  is similar to the Chinese one...with 12 animals (ya, I'm a pig). There are also five colors which elude me at the moment, although I know two of them are black and gold. The Chinese use five elements: metal, earth, wood, fire and water. This year is  urlLink Year of the Wood Monkey , which I guess is better than 1981... urlLink Year of the Wood Cock/Rooster . (Hehe, had to put that in there.) Anyways, at age 60 you've gone through all 12 years 5 times for each of the colors/elements...a truly magical time, I guess. Thus, by age 60 men (no mention of women) should have at least one grandchild, preferably a grandSON--one more reason to be happy that we had our oldest boy in my wife's father's 60th year!  Now about foreingers (as I/we call all non-Koreans...even in Canada for some reason). Korea ain't called  urlLink The Hermit Kingdom  for nothin'. Basically, there are very, very few foreigners here. Something like 200,000 in a country of 48 Million. Most of us are (like me) in Seoul and (not like me) teachers. Others are manual labour workers from China, India and Southeast Asia (doing the  urlLink 3D-dirty, dangerous, difficult-jobs  that Koreans feel they no longer need to perform en mass).  Foreigners (or 외국인/weigook-in or 외국사람/weigook-saram) are treated quite differently from native Koreans (and likely for good reason in some cases). We all need to register with our local 구/ku (ward/borough) office and do so (i) every 12 months or (ii) if we move to another 구 (whichever comes first). We get an Alien Registration Card that has our pic and address on it as well as our visa type (teachers are E-2, I fall under E-7 or 'other worker, director'). We need the ARC to get a job, get a bank account or do almost everything else official here. But it's not the same as a Korean Citizenship Card. Some promotions, for example the bonus card for  urlLink Fantaseum , is only for Koreans, not me. So I can't get 10% off movies or get bonus points there...waaaaaaaaa!  Also,  urlLink foreigners cannot easily buy land in Korea  (although I've also heard that it just can't be done...not sure who to believe on this).  urlLink Foreign investment companies, however, still did so --and did in great amounts after the 1997 financial crisis. (In fact, they were the first firms in Korea to EVER use due diligence/research before buying and developing land...Korean execs, it seems, did it based more on intuition than anything else before then.)  It's also hard for foreign firms to get market share here--unless they partner with a local firm such as Otis did with LG Group concerning elevators and escalators. Heck, foreign car makers have just  urlLink 3% of the local market ! (Not counting GM's recent purchase of Daewoo Motors, which is a small player anyways.)  One thing foreigners have had some success in doing is buying all or parts of troubled Korean companies. Korean firms put off foreign investment as long as possible, but in the end they  can  take on foreign investors-- urlLink 대한생명/DaeHan sengmyung/Life aka Korea Life Insurance  is 5% owned by Australia's largest bank,  urlLink Macquarie Bank . Korean firms, however are loathe, it seems, to disclose what most purchasers would consider to be important facts about the businesses.  urlLink 교보생명/Kyobo Sengmyung/Life  apparently had months of due diligence done on it by  urlLink buyout firms , but in the end not enough was known to do a deal. Foreign firms have been able to  urlLink buy billions of USD in Korean stocks ,  urlLink SK Life ,  urlLink large portions of Korean banks ,  urlLink other firms  and one ( urlLink PCA ) is  urlLink in the running  to buy  urlLink 대한투자증권/DaeHan Tooja Jeunkwon/DaeHan ITC/Investment Trust Company aka Daetoo  (names here can get pretty long and complicated) though, so there is some opening up of this place.  Funny, the longer I'm here, the more normal all of this seems...not sure that is a good thing.          \""
